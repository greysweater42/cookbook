A bunch of tips and tricks from a regular everyday R programmer who's trying to manifest his hipsterity by coding in [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) (or *me*, in one word). Feel free to create pull requests to the [repo](https://github.com/tomis9/tomis9.github.io) of this blog or just read, copy-paste whatever you need and leave this awesome blog in peace :)
