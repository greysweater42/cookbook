"Hey all, I just published [bliss-ui](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-ui) and [bliss-syntax](https://github.com/saadq/bliss-syntax) to apm. It's a theme designed for people who love base16-ocean/spacegray and like ultra-minimalism. No borders for tree-view/tabs, etc. 

The UI theme is a fork of TJ's [apex-ui](https://github.com/apex/apex-ui) which was an awesome minimalist theme, but I prefer darker themes so I made this one work with bliss-syntax.

The syntax theme is basically base16-ocean, but I improved it (the original was VERY red, all the variables, parameters, etc). I also optimized the syntax colors for ES6+ JavaScript.

[Screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6b273f44674c17a61cb52df08d490ea477574425/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f396353657274662e706e67) of the UI+Syntax theme together for those interested.

"I have been creating many plugins lately, I wanted to get some feedback on it:

- https://atom.io/packages/line-navigation
fuzzy search your file for really quick navigation (inspired by fzf.vim)

- https://atom.io/packages/arrow-to-return
converts () => 0 to () => { return 0; } and vice versa, which is a very common and mildly annoying transformation I do a lot everyday when using js.

- https://atom.io/packages/extract-var
just extract the selected text into a var or const on the above line.

- https://atom.io/packages/summon
creates a global hotkey to summon atom from anywhere (inspired by https://github.com/soutar/hyperterm-summon)

- https://atom.io/packages/atom-limelight
gives all text some opacity smaller than 1 except for the paragraph you are working on (inspired  by liimelight.vim)

- https://atom.io/packages/file-cycle
Opens a file with the same name but different extension on a cycle (like .js .test.js .specs.js ...)

- https://atom.io/packages/react-function-to-class
converts a react function component to a class, which is a rather annoying refactor that is sometimes necessary.

Features that I'd miss most:

* Intelligent autocompletion:

Atom actually seems to have this covered for the most part. 

* Navigation to method and variable declaration/definition:

Have tried Ctags, but haven't had much luck. Maybe someone could share a .ctags file with helpful settings for JS and CSS/Sass/Less? I'm not sure how Webstorm does it, but it works with every file type I've tried.

* Instant linting:

In Webstorm, I receive instant feedback on code errors. Not sure which linting plugins I should install for this.

* HTML/XML tag matching:

Changing `<div>yo was up reddit</div>` to `<p>yo was up reddit</div>` should automatically become `<p>yo was up reddit</p>`. Not extremely important, but does help a lot with flow.

"I have a few issues with Atom.

1 is that it takes a long time to open files. If I accidentally click on a log file, which I didnt actually want open, or may I actually did. It'll take about 1 minute before Atom will start responding again, and 50% of the time, it's enough to actually make Atom crash. I'm talking about files that may be 20k lines, and would take 10 seconds with ST, and wouldn't really cause ST much more than a light sweat.

2 is that, I as with most programmers, tend to have patterns that I use fairly commonly, things that I type a lot and want autocompleted. With ST, I know that as fast as I can type ```con [TAB]```, it will generate ```console.log(""|"")```. With Atom, unless I type slowly, I get ```con``` with a tab after it MOST of the time, because it doesnt actually auto complete, unless the popup has shown up, which takes a second. I know, poor me, having to wait a whole second, but it does actually feel slow and sluggish, especially typing those muscle memory things.

3 is that I can leave ST open with multiple projects, for *days*, and it will rarely get above 100mb, or anywhere near my top memory hoggers. However Atom, with even just 2 project, and a few files in each, I'm usually getting about 850mb+ in one of the ```Atom Helper``` processes. Again, my computer has 8gb of RAM, and can usually handle it, but with Slack being poorly made and hogging a lot, a chrome helper or two, and a couple of dev servers running, then 850mb is enough to start brining the machine to a crawl.

Any way to fix these issues? Has anyone else noticed these issues, or is it just me? I typically dont like to upgrade my OS, so I'm still running OSX 10.10.3. Is it worth getting Sierra? Will this help speed up Atom? I've heard missed stories, some people say OS upgrades ruin their machine, some say they improve it.

"Hi, I've been using Atom for quite some time now and wanted to make a short plea in favor of more reusable packages in Atom.

Packages are becoming larger and larger and more packages are emerging, which is great. Sadly most of these implement everything themselves, which is understandable seeing that Atom is fairly new and some things simply don't exist yet for it.

I think that we could benefit from generalizing more parts of packages, much in the spirit of the existing autocomplete-plus package. I'm thinking about things such as:

* A package that displays a bottom-panel could split off a reusable bottom-panel package that other packages can use as well (in fact, here [one already exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atom-bottom-dock), which is great).
* A package allowing generic test running for any language, then we could have things such as test-junit, test-jasmine, test-phpunit, ... and all of these would share a common look and functionality. This could in turn use a package like the bottom dock. To make this even more awesome, that generic package could in the future learn how to plug into the project-manager package, which already allows saving and fetching project-specific settings!
* A package allowing generic debugging, allowing packages such as debug-gdb, debug-phpdbg, ... I think here [one already exists](https://atom.io/packages/dbg), but no other packages seem to be using it.
* A package allowing displaying tooltips or call tips about various things inside editors.
* ...

Besides this, did you know you can let your package (optionally) save and retrieve project-specific settings using the project-manager package? This can benefit even packages that look for something as simple as a gulpfile to specify in what folder that gulpfile is located for each project.

If we could accomplish this, it would not only reduce efforts for developers looking to implement new providers or debugging back ends, it would also make the user experience more consistent in Atom for end users. In the end it also allows more comprehensive integration of language support (somewhat like an IDE) in Atom.

Atom is heading in a great direction, let's make it even better in the future!",3,13,Plea for more generic and reusable packages,Atom

My initial intention was to tweak certain styles only, but after making a ridiculous amounts of edits to an existing theme, I decided to start from scratch.

For consistency, it takes one colour and manipulates it for use in some areas.

By default, the theme overwrites the base editor background colour and gutter styles, so it works as intended with a ton of syntax themes out there.

"Hello *r/Atom*,

I hope it is a proper place for package promotion. I've just released [Helicopter](https://github.com/welldan97/atom-helicopter) package. And if it would get some traction, I would be more than happy to dedicate more time to its development.

The main idea is to have more sane keybindings for the editor. I'm coming from the world of emacs, and since I decided to switch the editor, I've thought to try to switch keybindings as well.  And then I've tried Vim mode. But it also feels quite messy, especially I didn't like the need to switch to modes, and keys seem to be all over the place. So I've created a raw draft of what I want, and then I've used the resulting keymap for more than a year. And recently I've decided to evolve it further, I've tuned it a bit, wrapped as a package, added docs, and I've just released it. Hopefully it could be useful for community.

"EDIT: I have some reservations, see my self-rebuttal at the end.

After 5 years using emacs, countless hours learning new things, and days setting up my C ide in emacs, I found myself with a 1000 line init file, a slow editor, and a running list of about 100 problems with it that I don't know how to solve.  Rather than debugging yet again, I thought I'd launch my project in Atom and installing the vim-mode plugin...

tl;dr From a code editing perspective Atom caught up to emacs* in 10 minutes.  I'm looking for new and fresh comparisons between emacs / vim vs atom, even if they are for your specific usage case (org-mode, or whatever).

It seems I'm about a year late for the discussions of emacs / vim vs atom (https://www.reddit.com/r/Atom/comments/3bik50/why_should_i_switch_to_atom_from_emacs/ http://walkah.net/blog/between-atom-and-emacs/), and some of the pro-vim blog posts are not that convincing unless your application is the same as the blogger's https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1
http://blog.makersacademy.com/why-vim-is-better-than-atom/

But Atom is changing rather quickly and new people are moving to it, so I think it deserves a new discussion.

* Qualifying my ""catching-up"" statement:  Atom has better tabbing and framing, with tabs grouped into a frame, intuitive git support out of the box (duh), vim emulation plugin just like evil-mode (have yet to explore : commands though), code completion and snippets out of the box, syntax checker plugin, smooth scrolling (which is so slow in emacs that many people disable it), line numbers and code-block hiding out of the box.  In emacs I was using semantic, helm, projectile, line numbers, magit, speedbar, evil-mode, among other things.  And that's just was a I discovered in the first two hours using it.

Rebuttal:  I coded with Atom for 2 days or so and missed some of the things I can do in emacs so much that when I had a moment to debug my emacs init file I did so.  Atom definitely did some things out of the box, but truly catching up to the level of emacs' helm-swoop, for example, would take a lot more setup.  It was easier for me to go back to where I came from.

Two takaways:
(1) It's good to know that Atom is there for the next time emacs breaks on me.
(2) If you are already good at emacs, don't switch.  If you are a new computer programmer / mathematician, emacs is powerful, interesting, and maybe worth the time invested.  I know nothing of Atom, really.",3,8,"Days setting up emacs as a C ide, minutes setting up Atom",Atom

"I'd rather use Atom than another app like gedit. I'm aware that in Gnome I should use gksu or KDE, kdesu instead of sudo when starting the app via terminal to modify root owned files. This doesn't work with Atom though, how do you go about this without the problems that sudo can cause?(files Atom writes to `./atom` would be root owned in the users directory which can cause problems when running as user afterwards).

EDIT: I followed a [guide online about pkexec(polkit)](http://www.webupd8.org/2015/03/how-to-run-gedit-and-nautilus-as-root.html) which is meant to be the better way to run as root instead of gksu/kdesu these days. The guide provides a gedit policy [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotice/webupd8/master/org.gnome.gedit.policy) and once you've followed the guide, you can run `pkexec gedit` enter your password and save a file as root. I replaced `Gedit` with `Atom` and the other two instances of `gedit` with `atom`, Atom does have a file at `/usr/bin/atom`, I'm not sure how important the action id and file name is, I went with `org.github.atom`. `pkexec atom` now opens Atom but when I try to save a file I get permission denied, this is in a folder where I can write files as either myself or root, so I'm a bit confused as to what's going on. Why does Gedit work but Atom fails?

Of note, Atom opened as if it was a fresh install not showing any of the my working tabs I'd usually see when opening Atom. None of my additions are present(I presume because they're in my user home folder under `./atom`.

EDIT2: So uhh feeling a little silly, someone pointed out that Gedit would have been a binary and there was a chance that I was providing a policy for a shell script....which turned out to be the case. Being new to all this that just complicates it more for me :) I don't think I should modify the shell script since that'd possibly get modified by an update.

I made a package for jumping paragraphs (https://atom.io/packages/alt-up), and I use it, but there's room for more improvement.

Then I tried vim-mode and it is great!

Now, can I get more?

Vim is very attached to raw text, which is amazing, but might not always be the right level of abstraction to operate.

So I started a little experiment for jumping tokens: instead of basing the navigation on words or characters, it makes jumps based on pieces of text that are meaningful in the context of a programming language (I tried this for javascript). I quickly noticed that there are many tokens which are uninteresting (semicolons), so I added the possibility to ignore them. Then I also noticed that very often our syntax does not conform a valid abstract syntax tree, so the parser (I am using babylon) will break. For those cases I used a dumb regex-based parser that does as well as possible (even though it cannot replace babylon).

In the end I was quite happy with this package so I went on to publish it. It might be that after a while this becomes a bad solution, but I think there might be something worth in the idea of operating on the AST, rather than raw text. If you are curious and want to try, the package is https://atom.io/packages/token-navigation

For some people atom is running extremely slow. It may be because of hardware acceleration. Currently there is no way to disable hardware acceleration except than calling it with --disable-gpu. According to atom --help the syntax for calling atom is:

>Usage: atom [options] [path ...]



So we could do 

    alias atom=""atom --disable-gpu""    

and then 

    atom myfile.txt

This didn't work for me. It just opened a new atom editor with an empty file. I assume it doesn't work for anyone else either.

Here is a solution for those who use bash.

In your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases type this

    
    # Run atom without gpu acceleration
    function runAtom {
    	atom $@ --disable-gpu
    }
    
    alias atom=runAtom

"Hi, I'm looking for some help from developers who write Atom packages. My research group is interested in the different choices new package managers and repositories are making when designing their ecosystems. Atom's packaging system, along with more general-purpose ones like Node.js/NPM, Rust/Cargo, etc. are making pretty different design choices; they also differ wildly from some ancient package systems like CPAN. We'd like to know what the impact of those design choices are on how you negotiate breaking changes among Atom package developers when the packages depend on each other. We're also interested in what you think the platform's design is trying to accomplish.

Could I ask people to take ~20 minutes of your time and fill out our survey at http://breakingapis.org/survey? I'll report back here when we've analyzed the results (or there's a sign up link to be notified when results are out at http://breakingapis.org).

(If you don't develop Atom packages, but do use NPM, CPAN, Hackage, or something else, we're still interested -- just make a different ""software ecosystem"" choice on the first page.

After installing Atom, I downloaded the Atom Runner package and configured it to run Python 3 by default. While I can run my .py files in Python 3, I can't seem to get the text editor to read my text using the Python 3 syntax instead of Python 2.

For example, in the above screenshot, line 2's print operator is written in the Python 3 syntax and line 3's print is written in an earlier syntax (Python 2?). However, it seems that the text editor only ""recognizes"" line 3's print operator as seen by the blue highlight. Also, in line 4, there is a suggestion of the ""raw\_input"" operator, which exists in Python 2 but not Python 3.

I've included what I want to achieve on the left of the screenshot, which correctly displays the Python 3 syntax of the print operator in blue.

3. jsdoc autocomplete
4. in auto complete, prioritise functions and variable declarations, such as from a required module, or as declared in that specific module
5. show autocomplete options with all possible options and whether they are functions or properties etc.
6. show autocomplete options after a dot, ie/ member functions/variables
7. auto formatter including braces under function name, and specific things such as echer loop should have a space below the closing brace
8. hold a key and click a reference to jump to the declaration (there is a module for a single file, however not fot multiple, also certain variables are unsupported. There is a vs code default functionality that does this
9. automatically update require statements in javascript when a javascript file is moved to a new directory
10. have user snippets appear at the top of autofill, and allow autofill guessing when non-standard syntaxes are used to declare the prefix, such as ‘…doSomething’

"Hi.

I've to work on a huge test file with a lot of describes, often nested, and I was looking for a way to either hide/fold some portions of the tests, or a list/outline of all the describes/tests.

I can't fold the describes because the folding feature is hindered by template-strings in the tests.

I tried [text-list-maker](https://atom.io/packages/test-list-maker) add-on but 1) it doesn't show the nesting of describes *(everything is flat)*, and 2) it's hindered by template-strings too.

I tried [spec-tree-view](https://atom.io/packages/spec-tree-view) but it doesn't support ES6.

Someone is aware of an other add-on that could help to navigate thru the file?

Thanks.

**EDIT :**
I modified the spec-tree-view package to upgrade it to the latest parser version so it now supports ES7!

I did a pull request so maybe the package will be updated if the maintainer is active.

If you want to test that now you can :

$ git clone -b ES7-support https://github.com/rndmerle/atom-spec-tree-view.git

"Hey guys !
I hope I'm not totally out of subject here but. I discovered Atom few years ago and never came back due to the freshness of the project. To be faire I hadn't anything to do with Atom since I was a first year IT [french] school and I wasn't too sure to do with it (so I installed vim).

But since that day, I tried Atom one more time and damn that's good ! I come from Sublime Text and I really enjoy the simplest things in Atom that are impossible with Sublime Text 3. And the overall feel make it more pro (certainly due to the absence of textual configuration, I ""hate"" that).
I dug into Atom customization a bit but I'm a bit sad : http://colorsublime.com/theme/GhettoBerryBlast

was my main syntax theme on Sublime Text and I didn't find my love in the Atom Syntax Theme Field yet. So I really would like to know if it's hard to come up with a custom Syntax Theme, quickly and from scratch !

Or if you know any Syntax Theme that's the same as this [theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/GhettoBerryBlast) I would like to try it !

"Hey all!

Very, very new to atom. Fairly new to coding in general.

I'm finally picking up Atom after 4 semesters of using Gedit. I'd like to make that a relatively smooth transition.

I'm currently using these, based on recommendations from a friend:

* advanced-open-file by Osmose
* atom-beautify by Glavin001
* auto-indent-file by lucbu
* autocomplete-clang by yasuyuky
* chary-tree-view by h2so5
* docblockr by nikhilkalige
* file-icons by file-icons (friend said DanBrooker)
* git-log by nikhilkalige (Never used git, ever. I know it's cool, just haven't gotten around to it.)
* git-plus by akonwl (See above)
* linter by steelbrain (friend said atom-community)
* linter-clang by AtomLinter
* minimap by atom-minimap
* multi-cursor by joseramonc (I'll likely never use this)
* remote-sync by yongkangchen (No idea what this does)
* pdf-view by izuzak 

Things I'm going to need to do/work with:

* C programming, exclusively. Won't need to mess with other languages. 
* Makefiles for compilation
* Header files
* PDFs with the instructions in them (hence the pdf viewer)
* Doxygen comments in the C files
* More stuff if I remember

**So, do you all have any recommendations?** Like, ""You should really get package X to help with Y!"" or ""X package is better than your current Y package, so remove that one!"" 

EDIT: A way to use my makefile in atom and run the executables would be lovely.

So basically, busy-signal shows that linter is in idle at all times, there are no errors and warnings in any C file (even if I add blatantly obvious incorrect statements) and neither of the packages display any error alerts.

"Alright so I tried Atom while I was in Windows 10 and it was awesome, so recently when I installed Debian 9 on my laptop, the first thing I thought of installing was atom. Did so using the official manual and succeeded in adding atom, but then came the problem.
For some odd reason it seems to run impractically slow when I try to go to install packages tab in the setting.

The search takes about 30 minutes sometimes, sometimes it happens immediately, even the total number of downloads value takes 30 minutes to load.
The download and install takes 30 minute to an hour or more depending on package, e.g. atom-material-ui took about 20 minutes to install.
apm from the terminal provides faster search but is same when it comes to installing.
If I have initiated the search, no file can be selected from the project view tree, until a restart of atom.

I thought this problem was only with debian so I tried

Arch linux: got same results.

Parrotsec: got same results(even with atom preinstalled).

Ubuntu 18.3: surprisingly it worked perfectly.

Windows 10: works perfectly fine.

All on the same laptop

I tried different methods of download, by adding the repo shown in manual, by manually downloading the .deb file, by using snap package installer all gave similar result.

"I've been wanting to switch over to Atom from VS Code for several reasons, but the only thing holding me back is that autocompletion is so much better in VS Code. I'm hoping somebody can give me some suggestions on settings or packages that can help make it comparable in Atom?

My biggest problem is the fact that variables for some reason aren't included in the initial suggestions displayed by emmet. If eventually you type enough letters to rule out all the initial suggestions (which I believe are exclusively keywords and snippets?) then it'll start suggesting variable names, but I can't understand why they're not just displayed from the start. On top of that, if the variable name still fuzzy matches a keyword, when you hit enter it'll change what you typed into that keyword (e.g. ""foo"" turns into ""forof"" even though it's a defined variable), which is very annoying. In most editors I've used, if you type a variable name and hit enter, it won't change anything because it recognizes that name as a valid suggestion, but with Atom that's not the case.

The other problem is that support for javascript's (and possibly other languages') built in functions/classes seems to be lacking. If you type ""f"" in VS Code the suggestions immediately include a bunch of results of things like ""fetch"" and ""File"" but in Atom it only displays around 5 keywords and snippets. I'm assuming I'm just lacking a package required for this functionality, but I couldn't seem to figure out which one.

"Assume you want Jupyter notebook experience but in IDE like Atom/Visual Studio Code.

So you either write markdown document with insertions of python code blocks. You can run these code blocks via Atom's Hydrogen package and instantly see their results. 

Or you write Hydrogen .py file split by `# %%` separator into cells. You can run these cells via Hydrogen and instantly see results. You even can edit this file in PyCharm studio as it's a valid python (unless you use magics).

If you want to convert this document to some output format (html/pdf/ipynb) and send to other people then you use [Pandoctools](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools). It can convert both .md and .py files described above to valid mardown, or valid ipynb, or html,  or pdf (but default pandoc templates are not what I like).

And Pandoctools not just converts - it gives you ability to tweak and tune the process of conversion the way you like. Then save this conversion algorithm as profile and reuse it. It's really convenient to use Pandoc with it's filters for this task - or even use simple CLI pipe text filters.

And you write conversion algorithm in bash script - the best language for this task as it can easily glue and combine text filters written in any language (as long as they have command line interface).

So in the proposed tool chain you:

* Write Markdown in Atom (with all available packages that help much),
* Insert Jupyter code cells and deploy via Hydrogen,
* Apply any Pandoc or text filters via [Pandoctools](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools) to convert to markdown/html/pdf/ipynb,
    * Pandoctools lets you define text filters pipelines (""profiles"") and apply them to any file by simply adding two lines to markdown metadata section and opening the file with Pandoctools. You define text conversion algorithm once and then just use it with few 'Open with' clicks (or even with one short key with Atom package).
    * Collecting Jupyter cells outputs is also a Pandoc filter,
    * There are even working cross-references in exported ipynb,
    * Can convert markdown to markdown in order to post-convert with existing tools,
    * Optionally write math in SugarTeX that is a more readable LaTeX language extension and a transpiler to LaTeX.

[**Example doc**](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools/blob/master/examples): from markdown with Jupyter python code blocks, SugarTeX math and cross-references to ipynb notebook.

See more about all mentioned tools in [Pandoctools repo](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools).

There are also recommendations of nice Atom packages and even good open-source font fallback chains for Unicode-rich markdown documents (monospace for editor, serif/sans for output).

**UPD**

Worth noting that there is another way of joining plain markdown documents with Jupyter notebooks: storing Jupyter notebooks in markdown format - you still use Jupyter but have another content manager (or something). [notedown, podoc and ipymd](https://gist.github.com/mrtns/da998d5fde666d6da26807e1f246246e) go this way.

Another way is to abandon writing code in Jupyter (I myself find it frustrating) and write it in Atom editor with Hydrogen package. But then the question of export to ipynb arises. And Pandoctools solves this problem.

And even more! It's shell pipelines allow you to add custom text transformations and leverage pandoc filters. So for example I added SugarTeX filter because I didn't liked how LaTeX insertions look alien in Markdown (I guess it's because of low readability of LaTeX - both Python and Markdown are very readable languages).

"I've been using Atom to develop an Electron app and it's been going well but I recently decided to try using GitHub for versioning.  I created a GitHub account (paid so it's private), created a repository for the project, and then I tried to figure out what do in Atom to use that repository.  

Is it just me or is there little or no information about how to to use GitHub in Atom?  As a side note, I'm new to the entire concept of Git (not to versioning but this form of it) and at first I spent time learning about the CLI but I thought I might as well focus on Atom because I'm using that as an editor.  

I don't know if this is correct or not but what I did it this:

1. Initialize Git project
2. Go to .git -> config
3.  Added (above [core]):
[Remote ""origin""]
url = [my rep url]

* there was something else I added here but I don't remember what at the moment

After adding that nothing changed.  I saved the file and it wasn't until I closed the application and re-opened it that it finally registered the change and prompted me for the GitHub username and password and token.

Does anyone have any instructions on how to setup GitHub for a project that's already been started?

I've watched several YT videos but they all seemed to skip past the step I described above and I didn't find anything about configuring GitHub on the Atom site.

I use Mactype in Windows to make the fonts more realistic and to remove the distortion the hinting system introduces, so letters are pleasant to look at and I can do my thing without having my eyes bleed from the sharp edges and extremely thin lines.

Here's a screenshot of Atom with Mactype. Background is Vivaldi browser with DirectWrite disabled too, so Mactype can be used: http://image.prntscr.com/image/f41aa91eef584e9eb290d6bfac5e31f2.png

Now, this same flag has been removed from the Chromium 52 Canary build with the excuse of thinning down the codebase, leaving thousands of people who need to disable DW for one reason or another (not just Mactype) stranded with only the prospect of going to Firefox in the future if it's not fixed. But I'm okay with that, the problem now that I want to ask is what is going to happen to Atom? Will I be unable to use the ""--disable-direct-write"" flag next time Atom updates to a newer version?

"Hello!

I have weird problem with atom. This image from atom-typescript homepage claims that errors should be highlighted on red (I mean red underline on ""123""):

https://i.github-camo.com/3df14009e89f9d3587cf20fabec3386e932596c8/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f547970655374726f6e672f61746f6d2d747970657363726970742f6d61737465722f646f63732f73637265656e732f656d69742532306572726f722e706e67

But my atom unfortunately does not highlight it. It looks like that:
http://s31.postimg.org/61cmrhykb/Screenshot_194.png

As you can see there is error in this file at line 17, which is even stated on statusbar, but on source code there is no highlight at all.

I dont use many plugins, there are just few for php, minimap, sass, js and typescript. I do use custom themes for editor and UI but I've tried restoring atom default themes and still no error highlight.

Is there something that should be turned on for this feature to work?

"Hi all, I do a lot of e-mail template builds in Atom that involve European languages with special characters, such as ummlauts, grave accents, etc. I build my HTML files out within Atom using UTF-8 encoding, and the e-mails are sent in UTF-8.

The default encoding property seems to convert symbols to their ""named"" equivalent (guess I'm not sure of the technical name). For example, an apostrophe becomes

    ""&apos;""

(I know that a character like an apostrophe could be entered in plaintext UTF-8 and come out correctly, but I'm using it for the sake of example)

I would like to find a way to have Atom encode using their numerical HEX equivalents. So an apostrophe, after encoding, looks like this:

    &#39;

I've only had luck with numerical encoding across e-mail clients and languages, as opposed to ""named"" encoding that's hit-or-miss.

Thanks!

This is particularly nice for my current purpose (notes on Haskell books I'm learning from), because it allows me to put non-compiling code (e.g. examples) in a code block *without* Bird style, and then for code I want to be able to compile and interact with, I can put it in code blocks *and* add Bird style, and the compiler will actually compile the code.

The trouble is with syntax highlighting. Since the file is a `.lhs` file, my Haskell IDE packages can detect any Haskell code and highlight it accordingly. But the non-compiling code blocks are just recognized as literate comments and left alone.

What I would love is to fool Atom into treating `.lhs` files as Markdown instead of Haskell - then I can use the `language-gfm` to highlight both the Markdown-formatted text as well as the Haskell code blocks.

first: I installed atom yesterday on my windows 10 machine and it's a fantastic piece of software. My goal is to write my thesis (in LaTeX) in atom combined with github.


So configuring wasn't totally easy but now I got LaTeX working and I was wondering if I could easily do some more commands (maybe like a macro?) if I press a key.

"Hi! So I discovered Atom last week and immediately fell in love with it. I’m wondering what is the best way to compile and run Fortran code within Atom. I already have a compiler and want to somehow integrate it into Atom. I’ve noticed that there are many packages that allow execution of several other programming languages (e.g., script), but none with Fortran.

After spending a few hours browsing through Atom’s Package, I’ve convinced myself that the best way to achieve this with Atom would be to install a “terminal package” and issue the compilation/execution commands through the terminal. Does anybody agree? If so, what would be the most appropriate terminal package for compiling/running Fortran code?

I found many potential packages that would do the job, but - being a new user - I am not familiar with any of them. I am listing below all of these packages in case anybody can provide any feedback about using them or doing something similar to what I want to do (the download/star numbers are from last night). Eventually, I would use this with other languages that are not fully supported in Atom.

In the core settings of Atom there is the option to use the color profile configured in the operating system, meaning the background of the entire program has the same color as your operating system.

Yet, almost all syntaxes with white editor backgrounds (for example One Light) allow the color profile configuration to remain the same, not changing the color of the entire program, only the colors of the text editor.

Is there a way to make the editor take the same color profile as the OS and the rest of the program, while being able to change syntax coloring?

"We're making big improvements to how SublimeLinter works. You can read [all the details here](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/blob/next/messages/4.0.0-rc.1.txt) and track our progress in [PR #666](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/pull/666). 

Participate in the beta right now by editing your Package Control preferences and adding SublimeLinter to the ""install_prereleases"" key:  

```json
""install_prereleases"":
[
  ""SublimeLinter""
]
```

Be sure to restart Sublime Text after the beta update installs.

## A summary of what's new

- Highlight styles are more flexible and can be made linter-specific.
- You can hover over errors or the gutter to view details.
- Status bar info is more contextual and more useful.
- Review all errors in a panel that can be filtered on severity, linter, or specific error codes.
- Navigate errors using built-in next/prev_result commands.
- Navigation uses the panel in the background, and therefore responds to the same filtering.
- Less code, fewer commands, easier to maintain and use.

Another big change is we no longer generate ""(SL)"" color schemes. It was intrusive and in a lot of cases unnecesary. Especially so in recent ST3 dev builds. If you're on stable builds you may need to tweak the new styles setting to get the color you want, but it works out of the box with all default color schemes.


## The future

We're looking forward to your feedback to guide [further improvements](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/milestone/2). There are some things we still want to refactor, test and improve and make it easier (more fun) to work on and maintain. We may also break a few more things, sorry about that.

Credits for a lot of the work go to @PyBen and @kaste lot's of thanks also to @FichteFoll, @deathaxe, @gerry and others who have made contributions and helped testing, and @groteworld for guidance.

"Because it certainly seems to me that way. The forums are filled to the brink with spam, jps (John Skinner, developer) hasn't even been *logged in* for the last few months, the feature he added (tooltips) when development started up again for a few weeks is at the best incomplete and very limited.

When people in the forums are asked this question, it's always met with scorn and generally insults -- but it should be obvious to them, even in their denial.

It's not that I need weekly updates to feel comfortable using a software without constantly asking ""is it still alive?"". I just want to at least know if there's still a development roadmap that is being worked on, if outstanding bugs are going to be fixed or even if the developer died in a freak accident.

The community and sales are hurting: people that check the forums possibly with the thought of purchase in mind will immediately turn 180° after seeing the state of the forums, and potential plugin developers will think twice about starting their project given the state of Sublime Text 3 and the slow migration to the alas increasingly popular Atom.

"Hi Sublimall users,

Sorry for the long maintenance period but I'm out of time these days.
The reason of this service interruption is that I was too happy that many and many people ask me to be available to register, then server have reach max storage capacity.

In additional to fix this issue I took time to do a little retrospective of Sublimall work.
Working on Sublime Text plugin is pain in the ass. There is no community, no documentation, API is not well designed and there is absolutely no communication with Sublime Text developers. I think this is a result of a bad closed source software management.
And it's more and more difficult to develop on Sublimall with these problems. I think this is the reason why there are absolutely no contributors and why the development is slow.

I made the decision to stop Sublimall development. But you have to know that Sublimall and server side source codes are already on Github and they will stay open source forever. Then, Sublimall is not dead! My second motivation behind Sublimall was to allow you to install your own instance for your company or friends and you'll still able to do that.
You can easily install Sublimall server on a Digital Ocean droplet for example. Just follow this guide.

If some people want to continue development just drop me a mail.

Then, I'll shutdown the service in one month, at 1 December, it will allow you time to download your configuration and do whatever you want with your account but after that all data will be dropped.

Of course thanks to all donators ! To be transparent I've received not far as 250 dollars to pay server, domain name and development time during more than one year. Thank you guys!

I'm also working on adding support for [Cassandra DB](https://github.com/SequoiaStudios/DB1/issues/3) and [Maria DB](https://github.com/SequoiaStudios/DB1/issues/2), in addition to some other features (the big one being SSH tunnel support) which I'll keep track of on the [issues page](https://github.com/sequoiastudios/db1/issues).

Currently, it's at version 1.0.0, and I already have a few bugs to fix, but I'm hoping that by releasing this a little bit before its ready I can get some better feedback on features people want and other bugs. 

Finally, as a side note, I'm happy to exchange licenses for DB1 for bug reports/ constructive feedback. 

If you'd like more information about the available features, the [documentation](https://sequoiastudios.io/db1/documentation) is a great place to check! I put a lot of work into documenting everything well. 

Thanks for checking it out!

"I've been using Vim for almost 10 years now. I have my fair share of plugins, and of course added stuff to my .vimrc. I have been using GVim 99% of the time, not Vim in the console.

But there are flaws in Vim that I am getting sick of. The plugin can drag its performance down noticeably, and everything feels sort of hacky.

For example, I have a plugin for navigating through directories. If I want to cancel the traversal because I have reconsidered and don't actually want to open a file, I enter `:bw` - but this closes the Vim window (not to be confused with the GUI window that GVim runs in). So, if I had 2 column before, I have 1 now.

Or see how easy it is to get into weird states that obviously are undefined behavior. I've succeeded sometimes with messing up the 1-line Vim window in MiniBufExplorer that contains the list of open files. Sometimes I've had directory contents displayed there.

Or how in a few situations I opened a file and it was opened in a read-only buffer.

Or how I cannot disable the swapfiles without messing up other things. (And I never needed the swapfile feature.)

So, time to try out the much-lauded Sublime Text 3. Verdict so far: Cool! The vim command and keystrokes are still hardwired in my brain, and for some, I want adequate replacements, but I already found some (like % in Vim <-> Ctrl-M in Sublime). In a few areas, Sublime feels more clunky at the moment, like search & replace. In Vim, I can type it all in one like: s/foo/bar/g. This of course also suffers from the rather cryptic syntax, a problem often found in Vim, but is very powerful. So far, in Sublime, typing in all parameters for Search and Replace didn't feel as smooth and streamlined. I had to do some stops to enter everything. I am also missing the Vim visual mode, though it appears to me that Sublime Text 3 does have comparatively powerful shortcuts.

Now, one thing I need is Git integration. I found the Git package, but now read about Sublime Merge, and wonder if Sublime Text 3, Sublime Merge, and ST3's Git package can work together. Would be great if they could! Right now, I noticed that if I commit changes to the git repo outside of ST3, the Git package apparently does not notice it. Nor can I refresh the code modification indicators; the code looks as if I had never run commited the changes.

So, any suggestions from someone coming from Vim land? I'd love to see equivalent for these Vim plugins:

* snipMate: For example, when editing a C or C++ file, I type ""main"" then TAB, and the plugin replaces ""main"" with ""int main(int argc, char **argv) { }"" and positions the cursor right after the { bracket. The snippets can also contain placeholders, like ""namespace <name> { <content> }"". Once the snippet is inserted, the cursor jumps to the first placeholder, which the user can edit. Then, after pressing TAB, it moves to the next placeholder etc.

* Rename: Renames the opened file. It would be great if this can be done via Git in case this is a Git project (that it, it should use `git mv`).

* gitgutter: Partially already present with the Git package. I wonder though if this package also introduces shortcuts to jump from modification to modification.",10,22,"New Sublime Text 3 user here, coming from Vim. Quite impressed so far.",SublimeText

"Hey you guys! I've been working on a Sublime Text Package for a couple months now and the time has come for beta testing. I created a package that allows you to connect to a Postgresql database, execute sql on it, and view the results in Sublime. Obviously the plugin is pretty complicated, and I'm still working out a lot of the features and details. 

Currently, there are 3 commands (the gifs are the commands in action). 

* [Connect to a database](http://i.imgur.com/a8pYqMM.gif)
* [Execute SQL](http://i.imgur.com/Z6FfPi7.gif)
* [Change Database](http://i.imgur.com/fpzLFlF.gif)

I have some plans for a few more commands, but before I get there, I'd really love to get the core functionality working great, and so I'd like to have a small group of people that would be willing to start testing it out! 

What I'm looking for is people on different systems, using Postgres for various projects or reasons, that are willing to contribute bug reports and help me iron out the details of the plugin. 

Finally, I haven't decided whether or not to open source the plugin, or to sell it commercially, so what I don't think I'm looking for at the time is another developer. Most likely the plugin I ship will contain .pyc files, so the source code will not be accessible. However, I would like your guys opinion on it, and I am very on the fence about which way to go with it. 

Either way though if you would like to help me test it out, just send an email to beta@alexggordon.com

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!

My font is [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) and my color scheme is ""Palenight"" installed with the Material theme.

It's not actively indexing the open files as far as I can tell, and the folders I'm working in aren't that big anyway. But the CPU usage never stops...

v3.0, build 3143

-----

Edit: It seems that if I *hide* the windows instead of minimizing them then the CPU usage will chill out after about a minute and drop to <1%. So, it's something that goes on when the windows are active -- which apparently includes when they're minimized.

Double edit: I think it's the Material theme that's doing this. I switched to the ""Adaptive"" one that came with a recent update and CPU usage is way down. With my system's uptime at a week, Sublime's total CPU time is *four times* that of Chrome -- an app with like 40M lines of code.

[Here's a bug thread on Github](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme/issues/1128). The Material theme author has abandoned the Sublime version in favor of VS Code and closed the thread rather than dealing with the issue. Cool guy. 👍

So we all know about multicursors and how to play with them. Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Alt+up/down, ctrl+middleclick, etc.

Now, when you copy/cut multiple things, and try to paste, it's a bit tricky. If you paste with less or more cursors than the number of things you copied, it'll paste all of the content on each position, but if the number of cursor is exactly the same, BOOM, it'll replace.

And this is a pattern I encounter quite often. For example, I can duplicate a line pretty easily with ctrl+shift+d, but then after that I usually have to go and change this one variable on each line.

I already had the ST3 installed for Win, but I tried installing it for linux through the shell, which obviously didn't work. Doesn't matter, I don't want to get into that anyway.


What I did instead was a workaround. In /usr/bin I placed a simple executable file ""subl"", which reads:

     #!/bin/bash

     ./subl.exe $1

I knew that in windows command line, it is possible to launch subl.exe with a file as an argument and it will open. (I tried it, it worked).

However when I added the $1 to the ""script"", it does only half the thing I want it to. It does indeed open a file that has it's name set to my argument, but it's empty. [Screenshot here.](https://i.imgur.com/qpzUtxF.png)

"It amazes me that after 2 years of using ST I still discover new features.

Today I wondered if there was a way of changing the color of the vertical indentation guides. On the color scheme I'm using those were barely visible.

So I found you can of course configure it in your theme with:

    <key>guide</key>
    <string>#666666</string>

But the cool thing is that you can activate an option in your User preferences so that the [indent line of your current scope gets highlighted](http://i.imgur.com/2XwPvtL.jpg).

	""indent_guide_options"":
		[
			""draw_normal"",
			""draw_active""

And then on your theme

    <key>guide</key>
    <string>#666666</string>
    <key>activeGuide</key>
    <string>#dddddd</string>
    <key>stackGuide</key>

"I like how Sublime Text automatically inserts the closing bracket or brace ""[{( after I start one.

I found [this response](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4909&p=22059#p22059) on the ST forums so I can't take credit for the code.

"Sublime is a really great text editor. I was somewhat skeptical when coming off of my main-stay with Coda to give it a try, but after only a few days, my work had seriously sped up, so I naturally made the purchase happily.

Well, turns out I'm a bit of a dunce (shocker).

When reviewing my Bank Account and PayPal transactions, I discovered two payments supposedly to Sublime HQ. Now, usually in the event of PayPal taking funds from my Bank Account, Mint will prefix it with ""PayPal"", or simply just name it PayPal.

However, this time, there were two distinct (supposed) payments of $59 to Sublime, so I got a little worried.

Because of how PayPal has acted before, I wanted to make sure that SHQ didn't have two purchases on record, or if perhaps there was a mischarge or something (I only received one license). So I e-mailed the sales address, and asked for some clarification, and if two purchases were found, a refund for one of the licenses.

There weren't though, and Jon laid out a little scenario of PayPal crediting my Bank Account for cash and then going through. Initially, that's what I thought happened, but both transactions were labeled ""Sublime HQ"" which is weird for my Mint account to display (not prefixed with PayPal, as usual).

I did contact PayPal, and evidently either PayPal didn't label it, or Mint didn't (I'm not 100% sure which). But in any event, I did get it figured out to just a small error, and definitely not on HQ's fault.


I just wanted to compliment Jon's rapid response time, and his politeness. I really should have contacted PayPal first, apparently I'm just a dumby when it comes to matters such as these.

"This was something I found today while doing something that required me looking up a subroutine with the same name in a bunch of different perl modules.

So open the goto anything box (`ctrl+p` by default in Windows and Linux; presumably `command+p` on mac). As you probably already know, you can start typing in a file name to fuzzy search it or you can type `@somefunction` to fuzzy search function definitions in the current file you're in.

What I discovered today was that you can append the function lookup to the file lookup. E.g. if you want to find the `initialize` function in `API::Widgets`, you can open up the goto anything box and type in `apiwid@init` and you'll pop directly to it.

I discovered this by accident when I was nearing the end of my task, but I wish I'd discovered it sooner. It made those last few files a lot faster and smoother, compared to my previous methodology of opening the box twice (once to open the file, then again to jump to the definition).

You can do the same thing with `:#` to jump directly to a specific line, which is handy for error messages, e.g. `filename:123`",7,13,Jump straight to a function in a file,SublimeText

"Requester: HTTP Client for Humans

[Requester](https://github.com/kylebebak/Requester#requester-http-client-for-humans) is a modern, team-oriented HTTP client plugin for Sublime Text 3, built on top of the Python library Requests.

Requester combines features from applications like Postman, Paw, Insomnia and HTTPie with the elegance and power of Requests. [Here's a video of Requester in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVO5AWIsmF0).

Some of Requester's features:

- [Elegant, well-documented syntax](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/)
  + Easily set request body, query params, custom headers, cookies
  + Support for sessions, authentication
  + Forms and file uploads, Wget-style downloads  
  + HTTPS, proxies, and more
- Intuitive, modern UX
  + Environment variables
  + Execute requests and display responses in parallel, or chain requests
  + Edit and replay requests from individual response tabs
  + Replay requests from fuzzy searchable request history
  + Formatted, colorized output
  + Automatic syntax highlighting and pretty printing
  + Clear error handling and error messages
- Perfect for teams
  + Sharing and versioning of request collections and env vars
  + Lightweight, integrated test runner with support for JSON Schema


## Why Requester?
Requester leans on Requests as much as possible. This means Requester does most anything Requests does, which means it does most anything you need to explore, debug, and test a modern API.

It also means Requester uses an extensively documented, battle-tested library famed for its beauty. If you don't know how to do something with Requester, there are thousands of blog posts, articles and answers on Stack Overflow that explain how to do it.

Apart from being feature-rich, Requester is built for speed and simplicity. I was a Postman user before writing Requester, and I got tired of, for example, having to click in 4 places to add or change an env var. With Requester you might have to move your cursor up a few lines.

The paid collaboration features of HTTP client apps, such as sharing and versioning, are not only free in Requester, they're better. Requester works with text files, and as good as the developers at Postman and Paw are, they won't beat GitHub at collaboration, and they won't beat Git at version control.

If you debug web APIs for work or for fun, give Requester a try, and please let me know what you think!

When I type in SublimeText (I have Python formatting applied), and I type in (for example) a single quote, SublimeText is clever enough to know that I'll need to type in a single quote in the future, and automatically inserts the second, closing quote.

My question is, is there a another way (using your keyboard) to advance your cursor outside of the quotes once you're done typing what goes inside the quotes other than using the arrow keys?  Or does everyone just use the arrow keys?  

The reason I'm asking is because due to the position of the arrows relative to where my fingers are when I'm typing, the arrow keys are pretty inconveniently placed.

  =====================================

Notes
  -----
  
  For the next major version of SublimeCodeIntel (v3.0.0) you will have to ensure
  that CodeIntel package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/CodeIntel) is installed on
  your system usually by using pip or easy_install. The Code intelligence will be
  handled by that package and the command ``codeintel`` it will install.
  
  
  Please start trying to install the CodeIntel package as soon as possible to make
  sure you are ready for the upcoming version of SublimeCodeIntel:
  
  1. Install Python 2 and pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).
  
  2. Install (or upgrade) ``CodeIntel`` by typing the following in a terminal: ``pip install -U codeintel``

"TL;DR: it should be like the quick panel, but permanently open in a view, most likely in a split; like the ""Find in files"" results, but with an API to feed my own results into.

Vim has the [quickfix window]
(http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#quickfix-window), which is a window with a list of (basically) line references, which, when activated, open the corresponding file & line in an editor window.

This is used in all kinds of tools that produce a list of references: to show search results or build errors, for example. It's convenient to have the entire list in view while you're fixing the errors / doing refactoring. In ST these results usually open in a quick panel, which isn't permanent and thus not so convenient.

So I'm looking for some kind of implementation of a quickfix window for ST so I don't have to do it myself for my [Search in Project (with external tools)](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Search%20in%20Project) plugin, and some other plugins I'd like to write, too.",2,12,"Is there a ""list view"" API plugin for Sublime Text?",SublimeText

"I've bought and used ST2 ever since it was in BETA. I've seen a lot of people were complaining on the official forum about the popup screen and were trying to get around it so they don't get asked to buy it.
I can't quite understand these people, but they're getting pretty much the same thing all the customers who've paid money are getting - no updates. This is really unfair towards the people who've paid, including myself.


ST2 has crashed a few times for me and it wasn't due to a hardware problem, OS software bug or driver bug.


In all the instances I've seen ST2 crash, it was one of the following:

a) one of the commonly used plugins (SublimeCodeIntel)

b) ST2 was running something which printed a lot

c) there were a lot of files open

d) there were a lot of windows open

e) I was typing

f) some other things I may have forgotten

I've had ST2 run very slowly for me when:

1. opening large files

2. scrolling through large files

3. I had a lot of files in the sidebar

4. randomly when saving

5. randomly when typing


I was wondering what the developer of ST2 was doing last year and whether he's working on any updates to ST2 or not. Then he releases ST3 beta this year, says that the price is now higher and that the update will cost money.


Given that I've actually paid for this editor and use it all the time, getting some updates isn't such a big thing to ask for.


Given that there was a single update for ST2 (ST 2.01), I'm unhappy that the editor received virtually no support. It's absolutely impossible the bugs and defects I've run into only occur on my 2 machines.

update:
I've tried to get in touch with the developer a while ago. He hasn't answered. I've also tried to recover my password for my forum account. That's absolutely impossible because recovery emails seem to be broken or disabled.

update 2:
It looks like some people couldn't understand the message. I wish to receive SUPPORT and UPDATES for STABLE software. I'm not looking to drop the 4 plugins I'm using to keep chasing around beta versions of ST.

"I set this up late last week and have been using it successfully to sync settings and plugins across ~5 sublime installs. Just wrote it up [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11365948/how-to-save-restore-sublime-text-2-configs-plugins-to-migrate-to-another-compute/) for someone on stackoverflow. 


**For convenience, here is the process:**

* Step 1: use [PackageControl](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to manage all your plugins, its awesome.

* Step 2: Add a ""Sublime"" directory to your root drop-box directory (I replicated the full directory structure for the hell of it, `{DropBox}/Sublime/Packages/User`). Make sure sublime is closed, and move the contents of `{SublimeRoot}/Pacakges/User` in to the dropbox directory you just made. Delete `{SublimeRoot}/Packages/User`, and replace it with a symlink that points to `{DropBox}/Sublime/Packages/User`.

Use this same process on every computer where you use sublime, it accomplishes 2 things. 

* 1) The contents of your `User/` directory are synced, so all your custom settings are the same across machines.

* 2) Every time PackageControl starts up, it checks the `Package Control.sublime-settings` in your `User/` directory. If if finds a plugin that should be installed according to the settings, but isn't actually installed, it automatically installs it, no questions asked.

Setting up another computer with this solution simply requires sublime/package control/dropbox to be installed, then just delete the `{SublimeRoot}/Packages/User/` directory and point it to the copy in dropbox with a symbolic link. Next time you fire up sublime, package control will automatically install all your plugins.

***Creating the symbolic links***: execute from the `{Sublime}/Packages` directory

* **Windows**: `mklink /D .\User C:\Users\[username]\Dropbox\Sublime\Packages\User`
* **Linux/OSX**: `ln -s {DropboxRoot}/Sublime/Packages/User ./User`

**Alternative Solutions**

* plain old *git*. init the sublime User directory as a repo, and remember to add/commit/push, or set up a directory watch to do so.
* *rsync*. Same idea, would work best with linux/osx (and windows if you don't mind managing the dependency)

"Snippets in sublime are awesome. I'm sure most of you are aware but for those who haven't discovered this feature for themselves yet I definitely recommend taking a look.  
In this post I want to share one snippet I find particularly interesting: Wrapping something in CDATA tags.  

[CDATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA) is used to delimit text content inside an XML document (including HTML) that may itself contain valid XML tags or other weird characters.
The CDATA delimiters look like this: `<![CDATA[ content may contain anything but the closing CDATA delimiter ]]>`.  
As you can see these are rather painful to type. Time to define a snippet!  

The problem is that snippet definitions in Sublime are themselves XML with the snippet content itself usually wrapped in CDATA and nesting CDATA is not allowed. You have to work around that to make sure your snippet definition ends up as valid XML. Luckily, [somebody found a cool trick](http://gotofritz.net/blog/geekery/inserting-cdata-into-sublime-text-snippet/) to do this. Basically we can use the ignored snippet place holder `${-1}` to break up the closing CDATA delimiter.  

Since the blog post only shows an example on how to create a full XML document snippet I wanted to share my own universal “wrap this text in CDATA tags” Snippet. Voilá:

    <snippet>
        <content><![CDATA[<![CDATA[${1:$SELECTION}]]${-1}>]]></content>
        <tabTrigger>cdata</tabTrigger>
        <!-- <scope>source.html, source.xml, text.html</scope> -->
    </snippet>


There are now two ways to use this:

* You can simply type cdata[tab] to get the empty `<![CDATA[]]>` with the cursor inside.
* You can highlight some text and then wrap it by inserting the snippet via the command prompt. (ctrl+shift+p, type any part of “Snippet: cdata” or whatever name you used to save the snippet)

I also defined a keyboard short cut for opening the command prompt with the “Snippet: ” part already filled in, so you're immediately shown all your snippets. To do this add the following to your key bindings (replace ""ctrl+i"" with whatever you want):

    { ""keys"": [""ctrl+i""], ""command"": ""show_overlay"", ""args"": {""overlay"": ""command_palette"", ""text"": ""Snippet: ""}}

That's it from me, I hope this helps somebody. Let me know if I said something dumb and maybe share your own useful little snippets! :D

"Hi fellow redditors! 

I often have to use several tab groups with many tabs inside each group (for example, editing code of different locations of one file, with each location in each tab group). Sometimes it becomes really confusing about which tab has the current active cursor in it, as all active tabs have the same background color. So I want to give the ""active tab with focus"" a different color to make it less confusing.

I am using the Spacegray theme at the moment. The settings for tabs in the theme file are:

    // Tab hover state
    {
        ""class"": ""tab_control"",
        ""attributes"": [""hover""]
    },
    // Tab active state
    {
        ""class"": ""tab_control"",
        ""attributes"": [""selected""],
        ""layer0.texture"": """",
        ""layer0.tint"": [43, 48, 59]
    },
    // Tab dirty state (close button hidden)
    {
        ""class"": ""tab_control"",
        ""settings"": [""!show_tab_close_buttons""],
        ""attributes"": [""dirty""],
        ""content_margin"": [12,3,7,3]
    },

The active tab color is controlled by ""layer0.tint"": [43, 48, 59] in the ""Tab active state settings"".

I can add settings for tabs with attributes [""selected"", ""dirty""] like the following (from http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=11552):

    // Tab active and dirty state
    {
        ""class"": ""tab_control"",
        ""attributes"": [""selected"", ""dirty""],
        ""layer0.texture"": """",
        ""layer0.tint"": [133, 153, 0]
    },

However this is not a perfect solution. It only highlights the ""active and modified"" tabs. If there is one file with many of its clones opened in the active tabs of the tab groups, they are all highlighted.

Does anybody know how we can add another specific color setting for the ""active and with focus"" tabs?

Thanks!",2,9,Tab background color: distinguish the active tab with focus from other active tabs without focus,SublimeText

And then in that folder you can override anything in the current Theme - XXXX folder that is active.

So if I was using Theme - Soda, I could take the .sublime-theme file from that folder and copy it to the Theme - Soda folder within the Packages/User directory....  then any changes I made would then override the settings in the Theme - Soda file one level up.

"#Situation


Today, I restarted my windows 8.1 laptop. 

When I  turned on sublime Text, ST opened up without any custom settigns applied.

it gave me error messages that ST can't find a file.

I looked into the packages directory, the package is gone. and ST became unresponsive while showing me dozens of messsages saying ""ST can't find the file blah blah""

#Investigation
I immediately checked if the file existed. It should have but it didn't. Somehow my package was destroyed.

I opened user preferences setting file. and added my removed package, Boxy Theme, to the list. 

ST however ignored my ignored packages and keep on trying to find boxy theme file. Monokai was already set as color scheme

I realised the ST has my project opened. It was possible that sublime project file has set boxy color schems. I corrected those entries.

And re ran the ST, no 



#Cause

"I realize that the color-scheme is the editor/syntax colors, and that a *theme* is the UI colors including side bar and other items.

But these things are driving me crazy:
1.  When I have my user-settings open.... I will find what is called (or referred to) as a **THEME** by people who speak as if they should know the difference.  However, when I install said suggested theme from the package manager or find a **THEME** to install... my user settings *only show a change in the color scheme!!!!!*  Why is this so difficult??  I realize themes usually come with their own color schemes as well, but I am making sure I am installing the THEME....  So why is it not changing my UI... only my editor.  I always restart ST3 by the way after changing a theme or a color scheme.

2. I run into these problems where the entire application get wonky when I am in the middle of trying out different themes/schemes.  I read here someplace of someone complaining about this same problem... The solution was that ST3 had movied certain scheme/theme packages into a ""excluded themes"" status in some JSON file... but I cannot remember what file that was... I am at that point now... I cannot even see my command palette, and the tabs are all garbled.

3. Lastly, I have been looking everywhere for some relevant and reasonably up-to-date information on how to theme the command palette... I see many ""themes"" do in fact change this.... Here is a screen shot which shows a dark grey background with a light blue highlight bar...  http://imgur.com/wnP7Wep

And I ahve seen variations on this.  I always assume this is part of a ""theme"", yet I have installed every popular theme (virtually) from the past 3 months, and my command palette stays the same... and very unreadable.

So my question is ... Are Command Palette theme changes in ""Themes""?  And if I am having so many difficulties with themes vs. schemes, does anyone know the manual way to theme the command palette?

NB:  It seems like there is a slow decline in enthusiasm in ST... is this because the developer is really not that active anymore?? (I mean how long as ST3 been in beta????)... Are people considering other ""enhanced text editors""???

"Hi.

I wanted to invite you guys to test out this plugin I've been building for **Sublime Text 3**.

It gives STDIN input to your program through sublime text.


The features is that you give it a fixed input while coding itself (in the comments), and then you don't have to leave the editor or enter input prompts again and again, the same input is passes every-time.

I built it when I tried to start competitive programming, and needed such a thing. But I guess, it could apply to all sorts of applications.

For example:

    '''input
    2
    foo
    bar
    '''
    a=input()
    for i in xrange(a):
        print raw_input()

gives the output

    foo

The Left Shift key works fine. The ""]/}"" hey is also working fine.  But when I try to get the ""}"" brace using the Left Shift key, it doesn't work. Using the Right Shift key works though.

This is hindering my typing very much. 

Please help. Is this a problem due to Sublime Text or Windows?

"[JS Custom](https://github.com/Thom1729/Sublime-JS-Custom)

I've been frustrated by the lack of a good JavaScript+JSX package (babel-sublime being outdated and seemingly abandoned), so I wrote my own.

JS Custom starts with Sublime's core JavaScript syntax and augments it with a variety of optional extensions that add support for JSX, Flow types, and other nonstandard features. These extensions are not hardcoded in -- you can reconfigure them by changing your settings, and JS Custom will automagically build you a custom syntax definition with only the extensions you need. You can even keep multiple configurations with their own names.

Because JS Custom is based directly on a copy of the core syntax (using [YAML Macros](https://github.com/Thom1729/YAML-Macros)), it's very easy for me to update this package when the core package is improved. As new features are added to the core JavaScript syntax, JS Custom can adopt them immediately. This means that it should never diverge from or fall behind the core package, and it should maintain compatibility with existing and new tools designed for the standard syntax.

Give it a try by installing ""JSCustom"" via Package Control. Upon installation, it will compile an example ""JS Custom - React"" syntax that should be a drop-in replacement for babel-sublime.

Bug reports, feature requests, and other suggestions are accepted at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Thom1729/Sublime-JS-Custom/issues).",1,8,"JS Custom - Customizable JavaScript syntax highlighting for Sublime Text supporting JSX, Flow, and more",SublimeText

"Hello all,

TL;DR:  I just want ""passive-interface"" to be green (#A6E22E)

I'd first like to say I've never messed with Sublime packages, so pardon if I seem to be asking elementary questions; I am.

SublimeText 3 (3126) using a Cisco syntax highlighter package by IPyandy.

In the README I see:
## Customizing
If you wish to customize this even further for your own needs navigate to the Network package (Preferences -> Browse Packages). Edit the `Network Definitions.json-tmlanguage` file within Sublime Text. After your changes go to Tools -> Build, to rebuild the syntax definitions.

Within this ""Definitions.json-tmlanguage"" file I see a lot of ""match"" entries calling different ""name""s.  

""name"": ""network"",
  ""scopeName"": ""text.network"",
  ""fileTypes"": [""cfg""],
  ""patterns"": [

  	{ ""match"": ""ip prefix-list"",
	  ""name"": ""constant.character.escape.network""

From what I can gather, this ""constant.character.escape.network"" name is defined in whichever color Theme I'm using, which for me is Color Scheme - Default - Monokai

After some Google'ing, I ended up installing the ""Package Resource Viewer"" package.  This allowed me to type:

Ctrl+Shift+P
then 'prv' which allows me to Open Resource and open the Monokai theme.  At least I think that's what I'm doing.

So now I think I have all the resources I need opened and I created an extra match statement in the ""Definitions.json-tmlanguage"" file:

	{ ""match"": ""passive-interface"",
	  ""name"": ""entity.other.attribute-name""
	},


This name points to this entry in the Monokai theme:

		<dict>
			<key>name</key>
			<string>Tag attribute</string>
			<key>scope</key>
			<string>entity.other.attribute-name</string>
			<key>settings</key>
			<dict>
				<key>fontStyle</key>
				<string></string>
				<key>foreground</key>
				<string>#A6E22E</string>
			</dict>
		</dict>

I then try to build, but no change.



Help:  What am I missing?  If I can figure out one, I think I can do more.  I just need to know the logic in defining these colors.

Right now I just want ""passive-interface"" to be green (#A6E22E).

"Hi everyone,

I've used Sublime for a good while for typical programming languages like C.  I absolutely love what it can do and how it can ease a lot of common things.

However, at work, I deal with a lot of either proprietary and legacy code for which there is no easy syntax highlighting.  I've got a couple syntax highlighting schemes set up in Textpad because the syntax files for that are easy to set up, but they are not very powerful, which is why I'm thinking of trying my hand at writing a syntax highlighting file for sublime.  I think it can make day to day work for myself and some of my coworkers a good deal easier.

I've tried my hand at doing this in sublime a few times, but with no success so far.  Is there a place I can look to that has good tutorials of getting this kind of thing going basically from the ground up?  I'm willing to try my hand at anything really.

Since I'm using Vim keybindings, it's very inconvenient for me to have to use the keyboard arrows to navigate my recent files after pressing CTRL + P. 

So I'm wondering if there is a feature that allows the fuzzy search of recent files OR at least browsing the results of a fuzzy search via HJKL (vim bindings).

"Hey everybody.

I wanted to share this little piece of information in hopes that it will prove useful to somebody. I've been looking for plugins and programs that would let me easily build my LESS code to CSS files, but all of the guides and programs I found were outdated. So I started looking into it myself and found out that it is surprisingly easy to get everything working!

&nbsp;

This guide should work on all versions of Windows and all versions of Sublime Text.


Here's how:

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Open up a command prompt as administrator and type in: **npm install -g less**
* After that, if you want CSS minification support, type in: **npm install -g less-plugin-clean-css**
* Open up SublimeText and go to Tools -> Build System -> New Build System

&nbsp;

Edit the build system to suit your needs. Here are three different options. Just paste in the text and save the file as **""LESS.sublime-build""** to the default location it suggests.

&nbsp;

Build **.css** and **.min.css** files

    {
    ""cmd"": ""lessc.cmd $file_name > $file_base_name.min.css --clean-css=\""--s1 --advanced --compatibility=ie9\"" & lessc.cmd $file_name > $file_base_name.css"",
    ""working_dir"": ""$file_path""
    }
&nbsp;

Build **.min.css** file only

    {
    ""cmd"": ""lessc.cmd $file_name > $file_base_name.min.css --clean-css=\""--s1 --advanced --compatibility=ie9\"""",
    ""working_dir"": ""$file_path""
    }
&nbsp;

Build **.css** file only

    {
    ""cmd"": ""lessc.cmd $file_name > $file_base_name.css"",
    ""working_dir"": ""$file_path""
    }
&nbsp;

After that is done select **Tools -> Build System -> LESS**. You can now build your .less files in Sublime by pressing **CTRL+B**. This will generate CSS files of your choosing to the same folder as your .less file. It will overwrite any previous files with the same name.

If you ever want to edit the build system settings, you can find the file at *\Sublime Text 3\Data\Packages\User\LESS.sublime-build*

&nbsp;

**Bonus!**

If you want LESS syntax highlighting too, do this:

* Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
* Open SublimeText and go to Preferences -> Package Control
* Choose ""Package Control: Install Package""
* Type in ""LESS"" and find the package that reads ""LESS syntax highlighting""
* After you've installed the package, go to View -> Syntax -> LESS
* Voilà!

I'm not the creator of any of these software or plugins and all credit goes to the developers.

EDIT: This method is not meant to replace task runners. You should be using a task runner like Grunt if you're working with a larger projects. I just wrote this because I was intrigued and couldn't find a working plugin to do it. It's easy to setup and can save time when you need to compile a file only a couple of times. I didn't mean to offend you or the way you're used to work.",7,9,[GUIDE] How to build LESS to CSS in SublimeText 3 on Windows,SublimeText

"I'm trying to use Hermes within ST3 build 3156 on Windows 10, with my Jupyter Notebook setup being 4.4.0 installed via Anaconda.

I've followed the instructions in Jupyter's docs to generate a certificate, key, and a hashed password that is stored in both the jupyter-notebook-config.py and jupyter-notebook-config.json files.

When I run jupyter notebook from Bash, I'm able to fire up a browser and work to my heart's content. (Password is entered on first run, not thereafter until I clear cookies.)

I'd like to use Hermes, but I can't get it to connect to Jupyter. For Hermes' ""Enter URL"" request, I've attempted https://localhost:8888, the same with the value of my c.NotebookApp.base_url key from the jupyter-notebook-config.py file appended, the same with the value of my c.NotebookApp.default_url key, and the same with both (default first, then base; base first, then default).

Each of those attempts combined with a blank token has failed - but the c.NotebookApp.token key has been """". I uncommented the token key so now it's '<generated>', but that doesn't seem to have made a difference.

I'm not sure how to proceed in trying to get Hermes linked up. Any assistance or guidance would be very helpful.",0,6,Linking up ST3 to Jupyter via Hermes,SublimeText

"I use Sublime as my editor for emails alongside mutt, and while most of my emails are written in plain text, some of them are written in MultiMarkdown. When I compose an email in mutt, it creates a text file at a temporary location, and then invokes a command to open that file in the editor. My goal is to have Sublime open that file in a new window, and to set the syntax to MultiMarkdown. 

Here's my current editor command (%s is substituted with the temporary filename): 

    subl -nw  %s:8 --command ""toggle_full_screen"" --command ""set_file_type {\""syntax\"": \""Packages/MarkdownEditing/MultiMarkdown.tmLanguage\""}""

This doesn't work as intended. It opens the file in a new window as desired, but it doesn't set the syntax. However, if I invoke the command from the CLI without a filename, I get a new window with the syntax set appropriately.

Here's what I think is happening: sublime opens the window, sets it to full screen, and sets the syntax to MultiMarkdown. Then it opens the file, guesses syntax based on extension, and sets the syntax back to plain text. Running the same command with a .py filename results in the file being opened as Python, so that feels consistent.

"Hey I'm using Sublime to attempt to highlight a complicated proprietary log format.  I understand that it's designed for code syntax highlighting, but since theoretically I can build my own syntax parsers using regex's in the yaml 1.2 sheet theoretically i should be able to define my own scopes, and thus highlight any format I want. 

What I can't figure out though is how it actually handles scope names in the syntax sheet and color themes when you're not using existing ones. 
   all it says at https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html
is: ""scope. The default scope assigned to all text in the file"" I can't tell if this header value is mandatory or not, or how to use it.  Since I'm trying to create all new scopes, I don't them to have to live in an existing source or text namespace. 

So for now i have
    scope: mysoftware.log

in the header, and then my first match uses: 

    -match: \bstring\b
     scope: mysoftware.log.fatalexception

In the corresponding tmTheme, I have: 

    <dict>
                <key>name</key>
                <string>Fatal</string>
                <key>scope</key>
                <string>mysoftware.log.fatalexception</string>
                <key>settings</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>foreground</key>

                </dict>
            </dict>

I know that the color theme is being applied because if I change the foreground or background in the Settings key it changes.   What I can't figure out is how a scope in the sublime-syntax sheet relates to a scope in the tmTheme page.   Do they both need to use the full syntax ?  Do I need to name my scope in the outtermost dict, like mysoftware.log and then within the individual keys only reference .fatalexception ?

"Hello Everyone.

We are gathered here because we all love and like Sublime text, and we all know Sublime Text is geared more towards Web Development more, and more plugins are going in that direction, so with that in mind I wanna introduce **CppBuilder**.

Here is a the TL:DR : I wrote a plugin for Sublime Text to help with making C++ project building and running easier, this plugin will create a project for you, will generate a Makefile, Build that make file and run your generated binary.

Install
====
If you have sublime text 3 (For now) and on windows (For now), go to your package manager, search and install **CppBuilder**.

**Note**: Before doing anything else please go to  

**Preferences > Package Settings > CppBuilder >> User Settings**

and set the **workspace_dir** setting, it should be an **absolute path** to a folder, this where all your projects are gonna be created.

Use
=====
go to **Project > C++ Builder > New C++ Project** to create a new project, an Input panel will come up and you can type in the name of your project, Then it will make the list of folders (build, header, obj, src), it will prompt you to agree for each folder, just click Yes to all of them. (This might be removed later.)

######Keys (While new project is open)
1. Ctrl+Alt+N : Generate Makefile (There must be at least one cpp file in your src folder).
2. Ctrl+Alt+Z : Build the Project (This will just run make in the folder).
3. Ctrl+Alt+C : Build & Run Project (No Input) (Running the project assuming there is no input required from the keyboard, useful for simple stuff).
4. Ctrl+Alt+V : Build & Run (Console) (Running the project assuming it requires input, the output from the program is not captured by Sublime text, the Console window will pause).
5. Ctrl+Alt+X : Build & Run Project (This will build the project, and runs the project as if double clicked on the generated binary directly).
6. Shift+Alt+B : Clean Project (Will run make clean).

Link to GitHub: [CppBuilder](https://github.com/Sharlock93/CppBuilder)



For now its only Sublime Text 3, and Windows Only, and you must have **g++** and **Make** in you PATH environment variable (Sorry for all the restrictions, I will try to relax them if i find a good way to)

This is my first real-life-somewhat-useful project I have done, so I want people to use it, and I want to find more bugs in it, there are bugs, so beware, and please report any bugs you find, either here, or through an issue on GitHub.

Also more documentation are available at Github, I want to make this project as painless as possible to setup, but getting there is hard and its gonna take time.

"Hi everyone. (this is a crosspost from r/vim, thought it is ok to share it here too)

I've started a new project that aims to bring/emulate ST2 like features for Vim(MacVim currently). I've started it because I really like Vim and ST2 too. And lots of people try to emulate it. Vintage mode is not much powerful and fast like bare vim. 

But there are to much modifications some has to make in order to make vim really like st2. Thus I've included some pre-compiled binaries, plugins in order to make the experience more fluently (with the help of #vim on freenode).

Subvim has really nice features and the same shortcuts like ST2:

* `cmd + p` -> Goto Anything...
* `cmd + r` -> Goto Symbol on  current file...
* `cmd + k` -> Show side bar 
* `cmd + /` -> Toggle comment
* `cmd + [` -> Indent 
* `cmd + ]` -> Unindent
* `cmd + <number>` -> Jump to tab 1, tab 2, ...
* `cmd + alt + left` -> Move to next tab
* `cmd + alt + right` -> Move to previous tab

and so on .. and features like:

* SublimeText like colorscheme
* On the fly ""Goto symbol, definition"" feature for 41 languages together with Go, Rust,Coffeescript, Objective-C and Markdown are supported. No need to install externalplugins or binaries.
* Full featured autocompletion via YMC. No need to compile the YCM plugin, subvim has already pre-compiled binaries included.
* Restore latest state (tab, files) when quitting and restarting again.
* Automatic closing of quotes, parenthesis, brackets and etc..
* ... many other fixes and improvements.

It's currently not finished and there are many things that needs to be implemented. It's not aimed for vim-only users. It's just a niche for people that want to migrate from st2 to vim or for people that loves vim but want sublime like editing.

Anyone who thinks it's a good project is welcome to test and contribute :)

"I use ST to manage all my markdown notes. I want the notes to have multiple tags, and the ability to search them through those tags. What I now have is, one folder containing all notes, with folder wide search for finding anything. In the notes I include a tags line - ""tags: books, python"". And then do a regex search to find related posts:

* `^tags:.*(books)` - single tag
* `^tags:.*((python)|(books))` - multiple tags match any 
* `^tags:.*(?=.*books)(?=.*python)` - multiple tags match all any order  

While this does the job, it's not very convenient. I couldn't find a plugin that does this. Are there any? Or can I create a macro/shortcut ? How difficult is it to create a command (in the command palette that takes tag as input) ? Any other setups/ideas for note-taking in ST?

"BACKGROUND: I'm a screenwriter trying to find a better option. I've used LaTeX since about 2004 until when I started screenwriting. (LaTeX isn't well suited for screenwriting partly because nobody uses it and you must be able to share documents in that world.) I found Fountain and loved the simplicity of the Markdown-inspired language. It does most of what I need; I started with Highland but found the app buggy. Also, the Fountain language, while great for most of what I want, is missing a few things. When asking about those things (adding section numbers and inserting smaller files into a larger one at output, like LaTeX does in its sleep) someone pointed me in the direction of Emacs and Org-mode and I went down that rabbit hole for a while. Most of the time I was using Emacs in Fountain-mode. Then I started feeling RSI from the archaic Emacs keybindings (never had any noticeable RSI before) and then found a new rabbit hole of Vim keybindings via Spacemacs. Loved the Vim-inspired keybindings but I wanted something that would feel less of a kludge than Spacemacs. Considered going back to Emacs with Evil (hate hate hate Emacs keybindings). 

Instead, I'm trying to get Sublime to work with the baggage in the subject line (what I like about my travels). I've followed the instructions here (http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/09/10/fountain-for-sublime-text/) and here (https://doingthatwrong.com/home/2012/9/20/fountain-for-sublime-text) and the syntax highlighting isn't happening. 

I confess that I'm coming to Sublime with more than a little ReadingTheFinePrint burnout from all my explorations with Emacs and Vim etc. So I apologize if this question is a little basic. Is there something in the instructions there that I need to add or do?

Syntax highlighting works fine when I open a LaTeX document. Just not for Fountain.

Also, I am using an unregistered version of Sublime Text 3. I'm happy to buy it but I want to know I'll be staying before I do. Is anything ""turned off"" or otherwise different about an unregistered copy?

Penultimate question: once I've got Fountain syntax highlighting going, and add Vim keybindings (what package is the best?) and then perhaps a distraction free mode, please assure me that I won't end up with something with the latency and kludgey feel of Spacemacs, Emacs etc.

Final question: is there any way that Sublime can talk to my LaTeX compiler or do I have to go outside for that?",20,5,"Sublime + Fountain syntax highlighting + Vim keybindings, dancing together--maybe with a little distraction fee mode thrown in?

"(Yeah I know ""best"" questions are subjective)

But I'm amazed about how well designed VS Code is. It has necessities, but it doesn't bloat like Sublime Text 2. And it's more refined than something like Notepad++.

While some might like VS Code to be more extensive, no I think that's what Visual Studio is for. 

But I find that VS Code is excellent as an editor for projects, where the other parts of the tool chains exist outside of the editor. Thus one avoids some compatibility problems through this by not having interpreters etc. built into the editor.

I know it also has a debugger, but nowadays I find that I try to write code so that I don't need to use one.

"Today, I had the need to install Visual Studio Code because I find it very comfortable for Angular development. I have always been a macOS font rendering lover, but now that I have a MacBook and installed Visual Studio Code, I found with the surprise that fonts look exactly like they do in GNU/Linux: very thin and without contrast, and I really care about how fonts look, so I installed an older version to see if font rendering was different, but no, it wasn't. I found that the problem was related with system font rendering and not with VSCode itself.

With the coming of macOS 10.14 Mojave, the LCD font smoothing has been now replaced by Grayscale, making fonts look blurry on non-retina displays and making everything look quite different and ugly, specially in Chromium-based applications like Visual Studio Code or Atom.

Here is how fonts look with the default font rendering configuration in Mojave:

&#x200B;

[Fonts are thinner because there's no subpixel rendering.](https://i.redd.it/y2p8cn20ik821.png)

Now, if we want fonts to look better, we have to enable subpixel rendering, which is disabled by default. To do that, we execute the following command and reboot:

[Enable subpixel font rendering and reboot.](https://i.redd.it/4q09j8kjik821.png)

"I've been using VSCode for about half a year now for all my programming work, but I haven't tried getting Java to work on it until two days ago.

After some initial java.home-induced confusion/research, I got a simple standalone file building and running under jdk version 1.8.0\_121.

I figured earlier today I would update my version to OpenJDK 11, which was \*a battle\*, mostly because of my own stupidity though, I ended up getting the wrong package initially, but now my java.home is happily sitting in ver 1.11-something-something.

However, I don't know if it was a product of my install, or if I just didn't encounter it before (as I just was working with a standalone file), but I'm noticing a number of issues that have me scratching my head.

So,  I'm writing code for a very small GitHub project (just a collection of ctci questions/answers), whenever I try to run a java file in that I have associated with that repo, I seem to get one of two errors:

\-   Error: Could not find or load main class <className>

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: <className>

\-  OR I get something that says that the class I'm running is on version 55.0 while my JRE is on version 52.0 and is not supported (JNI Exception)

&#x200B;

Now, this repo is about 3 days or so old, and had nothing but a README in it until today.

What has me on my backside here is that when I write some separated, standalone java files (using the exact same code I used in the erroneous ones), it runs just fine.

&#x200B;

My nuclear option is that maybe I've just messed up my VS Code settings-wise (or Java installations) over time, and I'll just salt the earth and delete everything and reinstall, but before I do that, I was wondering if these are things that are usually encountered. I was looking for hours this morning for fixes, and while I was able to get past a few issues, I couldn't get anything reliable for what I've mentioned above, I don't really see a lot of Java-in-VSCode posts a lot period.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

So, small update, I did in fact just salt the earth and uninstall and reinstall everything and rework the java.home and PATH system variables, I can seem to get things to work through the terminal with javac and java commands, the downside is that my Code Runner extension seems to still be having issues and tossing me the ""class not found"", I cant debug it all that well, but its at least sort of working",7,16,"Getting Java to Work Properly Has Been a Struggle, am I missing some easy fixes?",vscode

**TL;DR:** Lot's of small code actions and more accurate extend/shrink selection commands for JavaScript and TypeScript. Trying to get close to WebStorm.

I love VSCode but really miss some of WebStorm features. For example, it's quite annoying to always add brackets to arrow functions by hand, or convert strings into template strings. These things aren't huge but WebStorm provided lots of so-called code intentions to do it with only one hotkey (alt-enter). The same goes for smart selection: VSCode just can't do it properly now, and many extensions try but fail (for me at least).

Failing to find an extension that would fill the gap, I created my own. It handles JS/TS using Babylon parser and Facebook's jscodeshift, so no regexps and silly crashes.

"Hi,
I'm not completely sure what's the best medium to ask for something like this, so I figured I'd start here. 

I'm currently trying to get VSCode working with a medium to large-ish (6000~ thousand files) project. The project layout is unfortunately non-standard for legacy reason (I can't even easily glob the files in tsconfig). As a workaround for now, we have all of the files listed as include in the tsconfig.js.

That works fine, except for one thing: at a certain amount of files (about a thousand), all of the VSCode features stop working. I tried bisecting the files by adding half of them at a time, then half of that, and so on, and at about a little under a thousand, intellisense doesn't work, cmd+click stops working, checkJs stops working, etc. If I remove just a couple of files, then everything works (and its fast too).

I tried removing different set of files in case it was some parsing issue that was breaking everything, but it seems more related to amount of code than invalid files. They're just standard ES2015 (we don't use anything experimental or even anything beyond 2015, for historical reasons) compliant files, nothing special.

Anyone ever hit this or know of some limitations in VSCode? I don't feel like a thousand file is that big, so I'm somewhat surprised.

VS Code cannot seem to figure out how to properly format/indent a file that has both PHP and HTML code in it. For example, if you had a PHP IF statement,  I would consider proper formatting for PHP or HTML code inside that statement to be indented. That way it is fairly easy to see the opening and closing brackets for the IF. I can't figure out how to get VS Code to do this.

 even when I try to change the key mapping for the save action in the keymap dialogue in vscode, whenever I push control-s a control-o is displayed. It may have started when I disabled the vim extension, but uninstalling it now didn't help.

Any ideas? I guess I reinstall it next.

"I've read the docs and some articles.  It seems that VSCode just can't do what I want to do ?

I have a folder A with say 200 HTML files and 400 other files, assume they're JPG files.  I have another folder B (separate project B) with a few HTML files and a few JPG and maybe 6 other source/text files.  In VSCode I want to be able to be editing one project or the other, and not see the JPG files.

The only way I have found to get VSCode to open the 200 HTML files of project A is to launch VSCode with no editors open, and then do a shell loop calling ""code -g filename.html"".

Once the 200 are open, I can quit out of VSCode and later relaunch, and it will open the 200 editors again.  I'm still in project A.

But if I want to close project A and open project B, I have to close all 200 editors and use ""code -g"" statements to open editor on project B's files.  Which means the next time I want to edit project A, I have to close the editors from project B, and do the loop of ""code -g"" runs to open the 200 files again.

It's unbelievable to me that VSCode apparently has no way to either:

- Save a project file that says ""these 200 files are open in editors"".

or

- Open all files in folder that are of type HTML.

Am I missing something here ?  It can't be this clunky, can it ?

Maybe I'm not supposed to be opening all these editors ?  But then searching across files would search inside JPG files and such ?  Confused.

[EDIT:  Okay, I think I found the solution: do not do ANYTHING with Workspaces, just use ""Open Folder"" and ""Save All"" and ""Close Folder"".

"I recently have picked up VS Code because I have a new component written in NodeJS that I need to be able to debug, and learned that debugging support was built in to VS Code. I have debugging possible in PyCharm for Python, but JS support is not available in PyCharm's community edition so I wanted to move my environment to VSC.

The application I am working with runs mainly on Python, and there is a new component that we've added that runs on NodeJS on a separate port. I have got my configuration set up to launch the main application, which spins up the Python and NodeJS servers.

Now, I would like to set it up to pause at my breakpoints when I set them in the NodeJS and Python code. I thought this could be done with the configuration with `""request"": ""attach""`, but when I match the port to my application's ports I only get an error (`Failed to attach (connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8888)`). I know this is probably because the port is not running my app yet at this point, but when I go back to run the attach configuration by itself, I get a notification about how the process has terminated unexpectedly.

So here I am, I don't know what I need to do to get my breakpoints to stop so I can step through my Python and NodeJS code. Here is my `launch.json` file. The Python process runs on port 8888 and the NodeJS process runs on port 8895.

"Hey,

I've been working at a relatively large company for a few months and have been trying to nail down a stable and consistent development environment. I work in a pretty large Python project (probably in the 100,000-500,000 lines of code range) and have narrowed my options down to Sublime Text 3 and VSCode. I really like the features of VSCode - the UI/UX are (IMO) significantly better than Sublime. But, the one thing I can't get over is that VSCode's go to symbol in project (a feature I really like to use) is extremely slow on VSCode (5-10s) but almost instantaneous in Sublime.

I've seen a bunch of github issues on this that don't seem to be resolved with a solution. Does anyone have experience working with large python projects in VSCode and know of a workaround / way to make this feature faster? So far I've been using global text search (cmd+shift+f) to kinda grope through my files but that can be a real pain.

EDIT: I have used PyCharm but found it too slow (and too much of a memory hog). I found that the features I used most (autocomplete, click to go to definition, linting, etc) were achievable on lighter weight platforms like Sublime and VSCode which is why I'm more inclined to use them than PyCharm.

EDIT 2:

Based on the github comments it seems like the issues (with python at least) is that they are linearly parsing the ctags file in a single thread every time you want to search for the symbols in a workspace.

I heavily rely on keyboard shortcuts to get around in VS Code, they massively boost my productivity.

"Hi all,

Been using visual studio code for a while now and really loving it, but there is one thing that bugs me with it  (as well as any other non-emacs editor) and I wonder if I'm missing something trivial.

The problem is navigating code without moving your hand (e.g., emacs commands like ctrl-f to move the cursor forward).

As a concrete case, lets say I'm doing basic html and i write

td and tab twice to get myself into

<td></td> which is fine and tandy.

Then I fill the tag with <td>John</td> but now, oh horror of horrors, my cursor is stuck between John and </td>. In Emacs I could use ctrl+e to get to the end of the line, but in default vscore setting I would need to lift my hand and press the END button to accomplish this, which to me is simply horrible.

So, is there a reasonable way to rescue the cursor from the middle of the line without having to move ones hand?

P.S. I know there are some emacs keybinding things available, but generally I'm happy with the vscode bindings, except for this one thing that to me makes it completely unusuable, and I was wondering how other people deal with the situation?

"Greetings,

So I installed VS code about a month ago and have been using it to mostly upload stuff to my GitHub profile and write C/Python programs and everything has been working out just fine.

yesterday, I tried working with a Web development (creating a simple web page in using VS code) and I didn't get any intellisense/auto complete/emmet for my html document. I am also not getting the general icon (I think it is '<>' for html ) that appears next to the file name in the side and top bar.

I have no issues with any other type of files like Javascripts, sql java etc.

Any idea why I'm not getting the suggestions for HTML,

"Various kinds of selections and highlighting in VSCode. Sometimes there's overlap; often the contrast between the types isn't distinguishable enough to be as helpful as it might. I played around w/ my scheme in the editor workspace settings then ran across a discussion by chibicode, developer of the Night Owl theme: [Contrast between the same words highlighted and selected #90](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/issues/90). Known issue, partly because as one developer says:  


> Unfortunately, VSCode doesn't have the ability to inverse the text color or specifically adjust the text color in conjunction with selections. Also, if you add alpha to the selections they will mix in ways that might not be desirable. When the selections stack, the result is often text that is barely readable.

Also, auto import 'Fragment' when I use <Fragment> and Component when I use Component (Essentially just auto import)

C) ""Suggested Import(CSS)"". How do I get it to recognize CSS files during import? AKA I have Component.js and Component.css - If I type 'import classes from './C' nothing will be recommended if I'm in Component.js, and if I'm not; Only Component.js will be.

D) Dark-Theme Highlighting: I have seen a lot of people use Dark Theme and their functions tend to be much more definitively highlighted than mine. For instance
    render () { 
        return () 
    }
for me render is yellow, all () and {} are white, and return is purple. For most other people the () after render are yellow, and {} are blue. This is a pretty minor one, but just curious why my highlighting seems off.

E) This one is weird and I can't always reproduce it: If I use the clean-up function (Cntrl-Shift-F on Windows) sometimes it works. Other times it will -destroy- the code. 

E.g. 
    <div>Hi</div>
 has become
    <d
        iv
    >Hi</d
    iv>

Before - but it isn't ALWAYS like this.

I cannot come up with a regex that will match the following conditions for a specific line comment style.

If the first non white-space character is an asterisk (*) the line is considered a comment.

I have created many samples that work in regexr but it never captures in vscode.

For example, regexr is cool with this:  
`^(?:\s*)\*+(?:.*)?\n`

So I convert it into the proper format for the tmlanguage.json file:  
`^(?:\\s*)\\*+(?:.*)?\\n`

But it is not capturing properly, if the first character of the line is an *, it does not catch, but if the first character is a whitespace character followed by an * it does work.

Where : is the actual ^ of the line and \t represents an actual tab character it should work on:
`:*******************************`  
`:    *****************************`  
`:\t*************************`  
`:* comment`  
`:    * comment`

`:string *******************************`  
`:    string ***************************** string`

"I am using VSCode in a workspace that includes a SQLite db (in WAL mode) file that gets written to every \~10ish seconds.  These writes cause temp files to be created and deleted with each write.  There's nothing I can do about this config or the location of the db file.

In any case, I have a .gitignore set up to ignore the db file as well as a temp files (\*.db-SHM and \*.db-WAL) that get created.  However, on every write (which creates those temp files and deletes them), this triggers VSCode to run `git status` to see if anything has changed.

The net result is that the blue ""clock"" badge flashes on/off on the source code icon in the side bar every 10s or so.  I know I can stop the badge by turning of the ""progress"" setting, but that's just covering up the problem.

Putting it in the Explorer ignore files does not help either.

"I've been syncing VS Code between two computers for a while now using the Sync Settings extension. I'm completely new to GitHub, so accomplishing that was a minor miracle - after a number of attempts...

So, adding a new VS Code installation on a new computer to sync, I'm just as confused - if not more - as when I set up syncing the first time. Here's what I've done:

Since I'm already syncing via Git, I don't have to go through the upload process on the new computer/VSC install, so I'm following the instructions in the extension's ""Download your Settings"" section. In VSC on the new computer, I hit Alt-Shift-D. That opened up my GitHub page and on the Personal Access Tokens page I have one (cause this is the only reason I have a GitHub account...), which I named ""vscode-settings-sync"". According to the instructions I need to enter a GitHub Token, so I entered ""vscode-settings-sync"" in the Common Palette. Then I entered the Gist ID (had to do some real digging for that - finally found it opening up the Settings and searching for ""sync"".

However, that process didn't seem to do anything and now, when I hit Alt-Shift-D I get an error message saying ""Sync: Error Logged In Console (Help menu > Toggle Developer Tools)."" But going there just led me down a rabbit hole in which I got lost for 5 minutes searching for something mentioning ""error"" and ""sync"".

I then tried just uninstalling VS Code to start over and even then, when I hit Alt-Shift-D I get the error message.

I'm really feeling pretty dumb right now for not being able to figure this out, but I'm just lost.

**\[EDIT\]**

Well, I don't know if this is related to what I've been trying to do on the new computer, but on the other computer that was syncing, now when I use the shortcuts or select the commands from the Palette I get a message ""command 'extension.<extension I used>' not found.

"Hi!  I'm looking for some help on designing a new VSCode language extension.

I have already implemented a language server and a client for a C64 assembler.  I hooked this into `onSave` and it works fine.

However, I'm having trouble figuring out a good way to plug the different extension parts together.

The way the target compiler works is as follows:

* The project contains a ""main file"" (say `main.asm`, but I'd like this to be configurable)
* All other files in the project are included into the main file.  These files are not compilable stand-alone (because they use symbols from other files included before them)
* Compiling the main file produces a .prg binary which can be run in an emulator.

Ideally, I'd like my language extension to work as follows:

* When setting up a project, I'd like the user to be able to choose which one of the files is the ""main"" or the entry point to the target app.  But where should I specify what is the ""entry point"" assembly filename?
* Editing main or any of the included files.  When a non-main file is edited, the language server would start a build from the ""main file"" and report any errors for the included files. (A full incremental build is super fast.)
* When I press `Ctrl+F5` in VSCode, VSCode should run my `main.prg` file in an emulator.  The run targets are usually added to `launch.json` but I guess this implies that my extension should also contribute a debugger adapter?

Now, I was able to get a ""compile and run"" target implemented with just tasks.  The task compiles my project and runs it in the emulator.  But the build step is unnecessary given that the language server already builds the same thing when it checks diagnostics.  Also now I get problems reported twice in the problems tab, once from the LSP and once from the compiler.  Furthermore, I'd prefer to not use tasks because my LSP implementation already has the compiler built-in, I'd like the extension to be self-contained, ie., you could use it to develop and build an app binary simply by installing the extension and no other tools.

I'm having a hard time deciding where to configure these things, whether I need a debugger extension too, and how (or should?) an LSP can write build result and how and where the output path should be specified.

I often would like to quickly open a file relative to the file I'm currently editing.

"XMLDoc is a weird thing due to it technically being made for XML documentation that can be generated with your builds but also just happens to also be tied into intellisense for documentation. For instance, if you do something like:

    /// <summary>This is the description for <see cref=""MyMethod(object)"" />!</summary>
    /// <exception cref=""ArgumentNullException"">What are you doing, bub?</exception>
    /// <exception cref=""NotImplementedException"">Don't call this yet!</exception>

            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(argument));
    
        // I said don't call this...
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

And then hover of any reference to MyMethod (including right at the definition itself) you will see the following pop-up from intellisense (VSCode's version in this case): [https://i.imgur.com/dsiUsqC.png](https://i.imgur.com/dsiUsqC.png)

Well, I was just coding something and accidentally pasted a line from one of those sets of XMLDoc comments into the middle of another method's body which just so happened to referenced another method with a `<see cref=""MethodName"" />` tag. My curiosity naturally got the best of me when I noticed that the *tag itself* was colored like it was 'active' so I hovered over it and .... it worked.

Has anyone else tried this? If it works in Visual Studio 'Proper', as I'm calling it, like it does in VS Code I'm going to start using it. How many times have you referenced a property, field, or method from your class and when you globally rename it (using `ctrl-r, ctrl-r`) it changes everywhere except in the comments? Well, if you do one of these triple slash comments with a `<see>` tag it will change there as well. Any comments and/or suggestions are much appreciated!

---

_Why is there so much focus on line breaks?_

I haven't been able to verify it yet but I'm curious if the same thing works in Visual Studio. All of the ""this line should be on it's own"" text is there because to do a ""line break"" in a way that actually makes it happen in Visual Studio's intellisense you have to surround your text in `<para>tags</para>` or use a single self-closing `<para/>` tag. In VS Code this works too, but only if you put it on it's own line by itself, or put at least one additional space *after* it `<para/> `. VSCode seems to have a few other techniques exclusive to it such as using a single `<br />` tag followed by an empty line, or ...strangely **two** `<br/>` tags in a row. The easiest way, however, is to simply use an empty line without any `<br />` tags at all. It's no more or less compatible than using the `<br />` tags since they **never** do anything in Visual Studio from what I can tell.

This is all worthwhile, in my opinion, so that you know that your documentation may look different between the two editors. To put it simply, Visual Studio removes ALL whitespace down to single spaces, unless you insert a paragraph break using: `<para></para>` or `<para/>`. The only way I can think of to get a consistent result is to use a `<para/>` tag on it's own line, or at the end of the last line with at least a single space after it.

"I've been running Java programs in VS Code for a while, but so far I've done so by using the Code Runner extension (which seems to work perfectly). However, I recently decided to get the VS Code debugger working for Java (as I'll be doing a lot of Java work next year), but I've run into a number of problems.

I began by writing this simple program to test the debugger:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(""Hello universe"");
        }
    }

After pressing F5 to run the debugger, I get the following error:

    Build failed, do you want to continue?

After pressing 'Proceed', I get this error:

    Failed to resolve classpath: Main class '${file}' doesn't exist in the workspace.

Presumably, '${file}' refers to the ""mainClass"" attribute from the following configuration that I had selected within the VS Code debugger (i.e. 'Java Launch'):

    {
        ""type"": ""java"",
        ""name"": ""Java Launch"",
        ""request"": ""launch"",
        ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}"",
        ""console"": ""internalConsole"",
        ""stopOnEntry"": false,
        ""mainClass"": ""${file}"",
        ""args"": """"
    }

My initial theory was that the mainClass attribute is using incorrect syntax for the template string (i.e. it should be using backticks rather than double-quotes), but I've since learned that JSON files don't use ES6 syntax and so the double-quote syntax is correct.

The Main.java file has previously been compiled into a Main.class file (probably as a result of running it with the Code Runner extension), but I can't see any reason why this would cause any problems for the debugger (let alone the error that I'm currently getting).

We both are using vscode, same version which is up to date. I use the built in staging and commit features of vscode but use the command line for all of my other git commands. My partner is using vscode for all of their git requests.

After some investigating it looks like some people found that vscode is corrupting some of the cached git files. It is not converting the CRLF to LF before the file has been saved. Git is reading files which have not been changed as different because of this. 

[This is the bug on github, which shows as closed but I think there still may be an issue lingering around, not necessarily the same one.](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/25879)

"I've been stuck using Dreamweaver's code view for a long time, and have tried many times to get away from it for web dev coding.  I recently started using Brackets, and I like it so far.

The only thing I miss, is that DW auto fills in things that are very useful.

For example, if in one document I have HTML/CSS/JS/PHP, it will:

* automatically show me all the PHP variables that start with what I'm typing when I enter $__

* Auto fill relevant CSS options.  So if you type background: it will give me all the possible options background would accept.  (plus automatically bring up a dialog if I need to select a file [in the right folder]).

* Prefill HTML properties with only those relevant attributes when entering an HTML tag.

Just in general, it helps out with a lot of little things like this that make the coding process quicker.   I've been wanting to move away from it for awhile now, but every time I try it's always the little things like this that end up making the process faster for me in DW (I don't use Design view at all though).

"So I started learning HTML. I do admit it's way simpler than I have had expected. I use brackets to do so, but it keeps annoying me to all hells. I like it's functionality, so I decided to ask here if I'm maybe just too stupid to set it up properly, before I will end up judging it as counter-effective. 
Maybe, just maybe I'm too blind to find the proper menu.

First thing: Are there additional themes to bracket for download, or can I somehow edit them?

The first light theme is pretty cool, but having bright orange text between """" is just crazy nonsense. Bright on bright does nothing more, nor less, than annoys my eyes.
The other, dark theme, makes me blind every time I alt-tab to check if the code holds up on a white website.

For the second part: Can I somehow disable auto-formatting/auto-text. In brackets?

What I mean is that every time I make <this>it automatically closes it like</this>. But pushing the -> doesn't take me behind </this>, no, I would have to press that arrow 7 times to get there. It's annoying as it gets me out of my groove, I stay would stay more focused on the task, if I would just write </this> myself. 

For the other complaint, whenever brackets puts an additional |Tab| of space feels pretty random and mostly happens when I don't want it to.

I would love to hear any sort of a response on how to configure brackets properly. It seems good, especially due to the hints it gives during writing. But it does seem to dislike me.",2,2,A few questions from a newbie,brackets

"Hey everyone,

Today I participated in an IBM coding competition at my university. It was a 3 hour long competition with 19 teams competing having a max of 3 people per team. The environment we were given was a Unix VM, with eclipse(java) and PyCharm(python)(those were the only two languages we were allowed to use for the competition) preinstalled for development. I thought screw those options and fired up one terminal for using VIM and a second terminal for compiling and executing my java code. My team was doing good, and we were just doing our thing. The competition ends, and everyone goes to get their well earned pizza break before the awards ceremony.

We wrap up pizza break and they have us come in for the awards

before handing out the rewards, they wanted to hand out prizes for honorable mentions(cool things they noticed during the competition and wanted to reward)

The first one was best team name

The second one was for a team that decided to communicate with another team for communicating and sharing ideas.

Lastly, they handed out a prize to the team for going old school and using VIM and the terminal for coding(which was my team)

It felt really good to be recognized for using VIM, and it makes me ever so happy I decided to start learning the text editor.

Lastly, my team ended up placing 3rd in the competition and got some rewards for that too, so I have to say it was a good Saturday.

This is an awesome community, thanks for letting me share my story with you guys :)

"I can barely read a single thread without some ""real vim user"" scolding someone about using plugins.

If someone uses plugins blindly, without consideration of the idiomatic vim way to solve their problem, then yes, by all means scold them.

But please don't forget that there are many of us who use plug-ins quite conscientiously.

Some of us don't give a fuck how lean our vimrc is. What an arbitrary metric. I care about stability/speed/maintenance/etc. all of which are entirely possible with responsible plug-in usage.

Some of us know we can ""do without a plugin"" with some vim scripting of our own. It's pretty fucking obvious. In the same way most software can ""do without"" third party libraries. Doesn't mean it's a beneficial fucking decision in any way, often the contrary.

Some of us don't care how many dependencies we have. We are comfortable depending on things out of our control. Not because we are naive, but because we weigh the consequences BEFORE we install them, and value convenience rather than paranoid reassurance.

Just drop the condescending attitude which often amounts to ""I don't value this plugin so you shouldn't either"".",132,262,Please stop with all this plugin shaming,vim

"Certainly I save sometime repeating commands and using macros, but that alone wouldn't justify spending time mastering this text editor.

Being able to do everything without moving too far away from the homerow is the real reason why I use Vim. Combine that with a keyboard\-based window manager and browser and you get a very soothing programming experience. I'll leave my mouse for activities such as image editing, 3D modelling and music production.

Of course, being avaliable by default on Unix systems and running in terminal are also big pros. But comfort is what makes me stay.

"I've been managing [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) for a while, and it's been pretty fun. I and a lot of other people have written some Vim plugin code which has been useful for a lot of people, and so the usage of the plugin has grown considerably. Up to this point, I've been the only GitHub user with the access rights to manage issues, merge pull requests, etc. I'm thinking about changing that.

I just got (sort of) back from an Easter holiday where I put my emails to one side, and I noticed that I've got at least 32 emails with associated GitHub issues and some pull requests to look at. If I work for a few hours, I might get through a good few of them. During any time where I'm away, the issues aren't really being looked at, and nobody is merging the pull requests. I think the time has come to seek out some help from someone who feels like helping with the management of a free software project.

I've been reluctant to ask for this kind of help openly before, because it's hard to ask strangers for help, and to trust strangers to help manage a project in a way that I'd find to be agreeable. I quietly wrote three simple requirements on my wiki page a while ago, and I think what I wrote is still applicable, so I'll repeat them here.

* ""Do you know your way around VimL?""
* ""Do you like this plugin, and want to help?""
* ""Are you generally an okay dude or dudette?""

If you can answer ""yes"" to the above three questions, and you're interested in contributing, then please send me a message.

"[romainl](https://www.reddit.com/user/-romainl-) and I are putting together a Vim advent calendar for this holiday season, hopefully with the help of you wonderful people and the #vim community on Freenode.  If you are unfamiliar with the concept of an advent calendar, here are some examples: [https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com), [http://perladvent.org/2017/](http://perladvent.org/2017/), [https://github.com/patrick91/awesome-advent](https://github.com/patrick91/awesome-advent).  The domain will be announced closer to December.

So, what are we looking for from **YOU**?  We are looking for 22 (or more) contributors to help us fill out the calendar.  The format is fairly simple:

* A little about yourself (system administrator, developer, professional blogger, etc)
* Link to where people can find you online (twitter, fb, personal page, reddit profile, etc)
* Article about your favorite Vim feature or plugin (and obviously why you love it)
* Screenshots encouraged
* Contributed with CC 4.0 license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

The schedule is fairly laid back:

* Sept 1st: at least 22 contributors signed up, hopefully a bit more because life happens
* Oct 1st: finalization of topics (no overlap) and light sketch of article
* Nov 1st: significant work shown (article content) and starts of integration into site
* Nov 15th: final versions checked in / handed over with proper license included
* Nov 20th: domain goes live
* Dec 1st: first article goes live

We are flexible in how you contribute, if you are familiar with github, you can contribute directly to the project on Github.  That is the easiest way for us, but we don't want to exclude anyone.  If you are interested in contributing, we will find a way to work with you, from Github to email.

We might also consider other types of content, from cute art to videos -- if you are interested in getting involved and contributing just let us know.  I look forward to hearing from you publicly on this thread or privately, just message me.

"Hi there!

Might be useless to share this story here but hey, I'm sort of proud.

I started using Vim in college but had to stop afterward as my first job was on Windows Visual Studio and the version manager did not see work done outside of it at the time.
Was able to switch to Vim again when I started a PhD and continued when I got my current position.

So, here I am, using Vim as my only text editor for 4 years in a row now.
Most of my coworkers made fun of me because of my Vim/Tmux workflow but it did not matter: I was efficient at my task and that's the only thing I care about.

Last Friday, one of them came to asking for some code related stuff and, of course, I fired up Vim and, of course, he said a joke about it.
While discussing, I edited some code lines at his will.
At first, he didn't even see it was done.
But when he asked me to apply a simple modification at multiple places and saw me doing it in a few keystrokes he paused for a few second and said something like: ""OK, you definitively have some magic keybindings here.""
I answered him it was simply vanilla Vim commands with a smile but was laughing on the inside.

So yeah, I'm proud to say that, at least one of my coworkers won't be kidding about Vim anymore because of a simple but efficient real-life demonstration of its power.",86,188,Vim pride,vim

"TL;DR: Select several lines containing 0 and type `g<C-a>`.

I often need a column of incrementing numbers.

In the past, I've used [vim-speeddating](https://github.com/tpope/vim-speeddating)'s blank incrementor which lets you select a line with a number and several lines without and it fills in the blanks with incrementing numbers. But speeddating needs the numbers to be 'words', so code like this doesn't work:

	pos_0.x += delta_0;
	pos_0.x += delta_0;
	pos_0.x += delta_0;
	pos_0.x += delta_0;

I'd have to insert spaces around the 0s:

	pos_ 0.x += delta_ 0;
	pos_  .x += delta_  ;
	pos_  .x += delta_  ;
	pos_  .x += delta_  ;

Which is annoying because I'm usually copypasting the same line to make a sequence.

But Vim now includes `g<C-a>` to accomplish this task! Instead of blanks, it looks for the same number on each line. It also doesn't require block selection.

Combined with [textobj-word-column.vim](https://github.com/idbrii/textobj-word-column.vim), I can `vicg<C-a>` to convert that first code block to:

	pos_1.x += delta_0;
	pos_2.x += delta_0;
	pos_3.x += delta_0;
	pos_4.x += delta_0;

"##Vim Essentials
At the time of writing this, I've been a Vim user for almost 3 month now, and truly deeply love. And a passionate, burning love it is, no platonic relationship. As such, I have tried to intensify and deepen my knowledge as much as I can, reading all the articles, watching all the videos and following all the tutorials. Now, as I feel at home, I started to proselytize my fellow nerds, as all Vim users do, and noticed that I keep linking to the same spread out articles, videos and tutorials. So I
want to create such place, mostly for my own convenience for future missionary work, and as a starting point for beginners.
**Redundancy should be avoided**, for example, multiple tutorials explaining the very basics are only confusing, only the very best should be linked (I realize this is strongly biased). Only one entry per topic, per medium. So, if you disagree with a choice, **please elaborate why your alternative is better**.
It would be great, if you, dear reader, could help supply valid content to fill this post. **I want this to be a colaborative work from this subreddit**, as such it is *work-in-progress*.

This should for now be limited to a certain type of content:

- essential reads, which every vim user should have read at some point, explaining a concept, introducing a hidden feature, etc.
- essential(-ish?) plugins, which you *literally* can't live without, improving base vim features. Lots of [tpope](https://github.com/tpope)
- essential ressources, platform specific
- maybe exceptionally documented or maintained dot-file repos, which may serve as an example

Things that do not belong:

- one-line reddit commments hinting at a certain feature or mapping, without extensively explaining it
- exhaustive lists of various plugins which absolute necessity is debatable
- colorscheme or font choices

Note: As an alternative (or in addition) to this list, use 

- [mhinz/vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore), a well maintained and authored ressourcelist.

"I am super surprised that everybody talks about Vim 8 but almost nobody mentions that...

- Bram Moolenaar did the last major version ten years ago

- The recent years of Vim's development were almost stalling

- Bram publicly questioned the Neovim team's efforts creating a fork and bringing new essential stuff like async to Vim—he even made kind of fun of them  

- After Neovim came out and has been developed at fast pace, Bram surprisingly presents Vim 8 with the stuff we wanted which before he decided against—all the stuff Neovim did and of course incompatible to the fork. 

Bram's decision on being incompatible should be challenged and discussed, would love to hear his thoughts. Since no money is involved, his decision feels even more awkward, why not welcome competition or potential contributors, being a team player, work together or merge? Or is it Bram's injured pride, the fear of getting irrelevant with some piece of ancient software?

Whatever 'meaningful reasons' Bram chose not to support a fork, now we are left with incompatible Vim variants which damage the entire Vim ecosystem. I guess that most distributions will package Vim 8 with their distributions, just because not everybody has followed all the happenings, and Vim 8 sounds like a solid choice, like going with the mainstream. So, Vim 8 might get the next standard and an awesome fork could die which I find sad. The Neovim team has been disrupting, they went ahead and it's a community developed software which is a huge differentiator to Bram's work and codebase of controversial quality.

What are your thoughts? Should we support both versions and should we write plugins for both or focus on one? Or is competition good and the Neovim team will deliver more and prove that still a community developed Neovim will outperform Vim in the long run?
 
Don't get me wrong, this isn't a rant, Bram created with Vim an fantastic piece of software—this is about the question how we should keep competition which helps the entire ecosystem so we don't end up with a dying fork and original Vim's development slowing down again for the next ten years.

One idea is that all distributions should either still package old Vim 7.x only to let people decide themselves or always package *both* Vim 8 and Neovim together. But how should we get there?

Sometimes when I'm testing a more complicated regex of things I want to delete, I'll just use the search (/) and build while watching the highlighting to see what's being recognized. Then I hit enter and have to retype it as a substitute command, because :%s/typetypetype doesn't show highlighting while typing, but /typetypetype does.

It occurred to me today that since // means search for last search again, that s// might mean substitute over the previous search, and that s/// might just delete it. It turns out it does, so now I can just hit /complicatedregexhere, and once it's matching what I want, I just hit enter, then do :%s/// and enter to delete it all.",20,164,:%s///,vim
"The relevant section from the help can be found at `:help 'incsearch'`. If you enable the options `'incsearch'` and `'hlsearch'`:

    set incsearch
    set hlsearch

... then all the texts matched by the regex you're currently writing on a search command line are highlighted, even before you validate the search by pressing Enter. IOW, the highlighting is constantly updated while you're writing your regex. If you don't want to enable `'hlsearch'` permanently, but still want to try this feature, the help suggests to install this autocmd:

    augroup vimrc-incsearch-highlight
      autocmd!
      autocmd CmdlineEnter [/\?] :set hlsearch
      autocmd CmdlineLeave [/\?] :set nohlsearch

It should temporarily enable `'hlsearch'` during a search. It seems that it doesn't preserve the state of `'hlsearch'`, so fwiw, I'm going to try this:

        au!

I'm a fan of the monokai colour scheme, but couldn't find a VIM plugin that I thought did it justice. 'Molokai' is the generally accepted choice, but it, and most other colorschemes just like it, only apply just the basic colour groups and that's it.

"The following is a power 100% unique to vim's ex mode; you can't do this using editor commands in any other editor -- it usually requires writing a script in editors like Emacs, and you literally can't do it at *all* in unscriptable editors, you just have to do such things slowly and laboriously, manually.

This is powerful enough to drive editor choice, if one embraces it.

This post is intended to motivate people to learn more about ex-mode by showing its power, not to serve as a tutorial to such a large subject.

Ex mode allows doing *arbitrarily* *complicated* repetitive edits to long blocks, a fact which is nearly universally unknown even with people who know all the ex-mode basics for doing *simple* edits.

The disadvantage is that the commands required are complicated, a little hard to debug, and nearly read-only, but that is totally outweighed in the cases where it can save hours or even days of manual editing.

Small example. Say that you're editing a list of page numbers in a table of contents, and the page numbers are all off by 22 (this actually just happened to me in real life, which prompted this post).

The key magic is that one can create a single-line compound command by separating individual ex-mode commands with '|', and then using the resulting compound command on each of many lines via the ex-mode 'g' global command.

(For the uninitiated: vi/vim grew out of a line-oriented non-screen-oriented editor called ex, and vim still has its complete set of ex editing commands in ex mode, that are unlike the usual vim commands. I don't have the time to do a regular expression intro, nor an ""intro to ex-mode for people who previously haven't noticed that it exists let alone that it is worth using"", does anyone have a pointer for people?)

So from here we'll assume the reader knows the basics of both regular expressions and of vim's ex-mode.

Also the bash shell is used in this particular example, although the technique does not generally require the shell. It does however indicate the vast potential of using external programs in combination with editing.

Let's say our text looks like this:

    A......Page 23
    by John Smith
    B......Page 73
    by Jane Doe
    C......Page 131
    by Alice Grey

And so on...but these are wrong -- they actually should start at 1, so each page number needs to have 22 subtracted.

I had 52 such lines, so the prospect of doing 26 edits, each one error prone due to mental arithmetic, seemed do-able, don't get me wrong, but annoying enough to prompt me to use the ex-mode approach, since I'm used to using it.

In other cases I have been faced with tens of thousands of lines of edits vaguely like this, which would take taken literally days or more to do by hand, in which case some form of automation is absolutely necessary, and this ex-mode approach avoids the need for writing a small software script -- which itself would be a nuisance and error-prone and vastly less efficient in terms of my time than ex-mode.

Indeed this approach can make the difference between deciding to do something with a few minutes of complicated editing, versus deciding that the task is just too difficult or time consuming to do at all.

So here goes, here's how to write an admittedly-unreadable but extremely effective ex-mode single compound command for that.

First I vi-mode mark the end of the text (mA to mark it with A), then I use ex-mode global command "":.,'ag/..../"" where "":"" starts ex-mode, "".,'a"" is a range of lines from the cursor to mark A, ""g//"" is the global command, and ""..."" is the global command's regular expression to choose which lines to apply following commands to, skipping any other lines (the ""by ..."" lines in this example).

We want just the lines that start with a capital letter followed by some dots, so that regex is /\^[A-Z]\\.\\.\\./ -- regexes are infamously unreadable but are second nature with enough practice.

We are going to transform each such line into a shell command to do arithmetic while retaining the non-numeric text in those lines. So each line transformed into a shell command will look like:

    echo $(echo ""A......Page"" ; echo ""23 - 22"" | bc -l -q)

The bc command performs the arithmetic (-q is ""quiet"" and -l brings in the bc library and sets the decimal precision -- unnecessary in this case but I type it by habit and is needed if you want non-integer arithmetic).

That line is piped to the shell for execution via "".!bash"" -- ""."" is the current line, ""!"" is the vim command to pipe text to an external process, and ""bash"" of course is which external process to invoke.

The line is then constructed by using the ""s///"" substitute command,with one regex to pick out the first non-numeric part of the text and a second following regex to pick out the numeric part. The substitution text uses \1 to refer to what was matched with the first regex, and similarly with \2, so the first half of s/// is:

    s/^\(.*\) \([0-9]*\)$/

The second half specifies the replacement text to form the echo command shown above to send to bash, so the whole substitute is

    s/^\(.*\) \([0-9]*\)$/echo $(echo \1; echo \2 - 22 | bc -l -
q)/

That uses | in the bash command for piping. In the final command we also use | as a command separator in order to add a command tell vim to pipe the newly-created command to bash.

Putting all of this together creates the horrendous-seeming command:

    :.,'ag/^[A-Z]\.\.\./s/\^\(.*\) \([0-9]*\)$/echo $(echo \1; echo \2 - 22 | bc -l -q)/|.!bash

And voila, we are done, the resulting text is:

    A......Page 1
    by John Smith
    B......Page 51
    by Jane Doe
    C......Page 109
    by Alice Grey

....and so on for 26 entries total.

Despite the unaesthetic scare factor of its appearance, note that this is far, *far* easier to compose than it is to read. I almost never save such things for reuse, because it is typically easier to re-invent a new complex ex command than it is to copy-paste-edit an old one.

I composed and debugged it in stages. First I did a simple global g// command, then I edited it (ex mode has history like the shell, accessible via arrow keys to scroll up and down through it).

I started adding s/// substitute commands to that, so it took a few tries to get the regex right and to finalize the strategy.

Somewhere in there I separately debugged the form of the shell command that would work best.

Total time elapsed probably 3 minutes.

In more complicated cases one might do a whole series of such compound ex-mode commands, to get the final edit done in stages.

Aside from the resemblance to line noise, it is also perhaps slightly boggling in its meta approach, of making commands out of multiple commands to create commands to send to multiple commands.

Now that I'm used to this approach, I use it frequently, not rarely, and again, this was a simple example task, but often what is needed is on much larger blocks of text with much more complicated structure.

A related common pattern is e.g. ""1,$g/.../-2join|join|s///"" to back up two lines from each regex-match, join 3 lines together, and edit the resulting line with a substitute command.

Using relative motion like that with g// is extremely powerful but not at all well-known.

I'm sure someone will say ""that's ugly, I'd prefer to just do 26 manual edits"" -- which is fair, but again this is a simple example of something that is essential when the alternative is thousands of manual edits (or writing complicated scripts).

And again, this is intended to motivate further exploration, not to be a tutorial.

People often argue for the superiority of vim's interactive commands, but although I agree, I think that ex-mode is a widely unknown and *certainly* under-appreciated, but possibly even more compelling, reason to use vim, in conjunction with its interative commands.

Apologies for undoubted typos in the above.

"**tl;dr**

Writing a book on Vim is very very hard. 
---

**Almost complete story**

It was December, 2014. I just moved to Berlin, Germany. 
I had a few job offers, and I was about to join one startup.
Those days, I finally decided to realize my idea - writing a book on Vim.

However, unexpectedly things went wrong with my work permit.

Long story short:
My homeland is not part of the European Union. 
The only way to get a work permit was - I had to have a university degree recognized in Germany.

Now, I did have the Bachelor university degree. But, it wasn't recognized in Germany.
Of course, I couldn't get any job in Germany. I had to come back to Serbia.

That's why I had to completely cancel all the work on Mastering Vim Quickly.
I spent a whole year on completing my MSc degree in Computer Science (recognized in Germany). 
I did it! And I finally back to Berlin.

It was a long way. It took a lot of time and effort, but it was worth of it.
I've found a dream job in an awesome startup. 

I got back to the book. It took more time and effort that I could imagine. But I didn't give up. 
Finally, I launched it last week. 


It's called **Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time**


**About the book**

I wrote it because I couldn't find a book which I wanted to learn Vim from. 
I wanted a short read, with the most important Vim features/concepts covered, and lots of real world examples.
So that's what I did. This book first covers a powerful learning techniques known to me. And then it introduces Vim, step by step.

"Want some fancy GitHub flavored live markdown preview while editing a markdown file?

No need to reach for a Vim plugin. You can just use a command-line markdown previewer like [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) and invoke it for the current file with a small function.

- Screenshot of the end result: https://i.imgur.com/04xibWR.png

- Vim code (Neovim job syntax, same idea for Vim 8):

        noremap <silent> <leader>om :call OpenMarkdownPreview()<cr>

        function! OpenMarkdownPreview() abort
          if exists('s:markdown_job_id') && s:markdown_job_id > 0
            call jobstop(s:markdown_job_id)
            unlet s:markdown_job_id
          endif
          let available_port = system(
            \ ""lsof -s tcp:listen -i :40500-40800 | awk -F ' *|:' '{ print $10 }' | sort -n | tail -n1""
            \ ) + 1
          if available_port == 1 | let available_port = 40500 | endif
          let s:markdown_job_id = jobstart('grip ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')) . ' :' . available_port)
          if s:markdown_job_id <= 0 | return | endif
          call system('open http://localhost:' . available_port)
        endfunction

    (for a shorter function, see EDIT 3. The port discovery code above allows multiple vim instances to preview different project files at the same time — something that grip doesn't provide out of the box)

- If you like what you see you can also check out my [vimrc](https://github.com/jeromedalbert/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/init.vim)

EDIT 1: grip also works on Windows, my tip is specific to Unix only because I use `lsof` to check ports.

EDIT 2: `open` is MacOS specific. If you are on Linux, replace it with whatever works on your distro, like maybe `xdg-open`, or invoke your browser directly

EDIT 3: If you prefer simplicity, here's a short version that doesn't deal with ports

    noremap <silent> <leader>om :call OpenMarkdownPreview()<cr>

    function! OpenMarkdownPreview() abort
      if exists('s:markdown_job_id') && s:markdown_job_id > 0
        call jobstop(s:markdown_job_id)
        unlet s:markdown_job_id
      endif
      let s:markdown_job_id = jobstart('grip ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')))
      if s:markdown_job_id <= 0 | return | endif
      call system('open http://localhost:6419')
    endfunction

EDIT 4: Here's a short version *with* port discovery that doesn't use `lsof`:

    function! OpenMarkdownPreview() abort
      if exists('s:markdown_job_id') && s:markdown_job_id > 0
        call jobstop(s:markdown_job_id)
        unlet s:markdown_job_id
      endif
      let s:markdown_job_id = jobstart(
        \ 'grip ' . shellescape(expand('%:p')) . "" 0 2>&1 | awk '/Running/ { printf $4 }'"",
        \ { 'on_stdout': 'OnGripStart', 'pty': 1 })
      function! OnGripStart(_, output, __)
        call system('open ' . a:output[0])
      endfunction
    endfunction

I created a series of interactive [Vim tutorials](https://www.vimlabs.world/), [Vim Labs](https://www.vimlabs.world/), that take you from beginner to a text-editing wizard. 

The idea is to make learning Vim fun by providing instructions next to a live Vim for interactive learning without installation or configuration.

"I am currently considering some changes to how /r/vim is run.  Nothing has been decided yet, but here are the current ideas being bounced around. 

- De-emphasis of stickies and sidebar, they are generally not seen / overlooked.
- More focus on building out evergreen answers on the wiki (opening up wiki a bit maybe?).  I am concerned this will possibly end as pointless duplication and competition with http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/ -- what do you think?  The goal is to be able to quickly link to answers rather than having to rehash them. 
- Implementing a fairly firm no assholes rule.  This means banning people with a **pattern** of poor behavior, not for a one off bad comment / day.  This will **not** be backward looking but from implementation point forward, everyone will have a clean slate.  Disagreement isn't being an asshole, personal attacks are.  Sincere arguments focused on the tech will always been allowed.  ""I recommend instead of plugin $X you use feature $Y"" isn't being an asshole.  ""You are stupid because you use plugin $X instead of feature $Y"" is.  No more platform/language/gui shaming, etc.

Little did I know a simple solution was out there waiting for me to discover it. 

Today I just came across a technique that makes the bash terminal have vi key bindings.

To enable the command-line editing with vi keys. Run the following command(put in your .bashrc if you like):

    set -o vi

There you have it, all the vim key bindings on your finger tips.
By default you will be in insert mode. Hitting ctrl + [ or esc will put you into normal mode. And then, you can enjoy the vim magic.

k brings up previous typed commands(it scrolls up through history). h,l,dw,dd,d$,A,0,$ etc all work as expected.

"Hey Vim peeps.
I kinda like listening to music and programming stuff using Vim. 
When finding Mustafa Ansari's (https://github.com/MuAnsari96) Vimify plugin last year I was completely sold.

Then I think it was 4 or 5 months ago Spotify decided that their search API would only be accessible for people with active user sessions... so suddenly the plugin stopped working. Going trough oath every time i wanted to use Vimify was kind of a pain too.

seems a few weeks ago, Spotify opened up their search paths to applications. So I took a copy of Vimify, cleaned it up a bit and integrated the ability to search for music again.

Put the plugin up at https://github.com/HendrikPetertje/vimify
It's still a spaghetti mess, I need to reintegrate Linux support and allow to search for albums and artists specifically... but it's a start.

Love to know your thoughts!

(Again Mustafa Ansari did the big work here with his initial plugin)

.  
..  
Edit 15:45:
I love the discussion here!

to be quite honest, I just wanted to try what is possible (while also shitting on some friends/colleagues that thought that code-linting was the most elite function in their sublime/atom installs). Vim is a pretty powerful platform that allows a lot of tweaking, I mean creating a complete spotify-interface that works, in 100 or so small lines of code (if you forget the comments for a sec) is pretty nice though obviously perverse. 

The fact that I can quickly switch music while not leaving my full-screen terminal is just a nice bonus at this point. 
If you feel like it's too much, then yeah I completely agree and will mainly just tell you to... not install it, I'm just having fun.

"I've used ""Tabular"" for a long time, but always missed proper text object support. Today I set out to find out some kind of a solution for that, or build something myself.

After some googling I stumbled upon [vim-easy-align](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align) and was blown away by all the features and how ""polished"" that plugin is.

* first things first: vim-easy-align has text objects built-in and they come as the ""first class"" feature. ~~They are definitely not an afterthought.~~ Ups, the plugin author said text objects actually are a feature that was added on. Still first class though.

* you'd maybe think that built-in text objects are just shortcuts to commonly used alignment patterns (like align on colon, or equals), but no: the text object API is incredibly feature rich and intuitive!
It's incredible how that API makes sense to perform an operation like: ""center align only the 3rd column by the comma character""

* the ""feature polish"" is **incredible**! Apart from the support for text objects it works with visual and block visual modes. There is also an command line interactive mode, something I haven't seen in any plugin so far (I'm still learning about this).

* But it's the little things too - lots of nice little things. For example when aligning, it respects commented lines (does not align them). Equals sign ""="" alignment will work on other similar operators like ""=="", ""==="", "">="", ""+="".... Different alignment characters have different default alignment settings: for example equal signs are center aligned by default, but colon has left default alignment (this is totally intuitive). Works with repeat.vim.

* not a feature in itself, but worth mentioning: the plugin has a big test suite. This will hopefully make it less susceptible to ""bit rot"". I also hope this means the time I spend learning it will be paying off for the longer time.

As for learning how to use the plugin: I re-watched the [slow gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/vim-easy-align-slow.gif) half a dozen times to ""grok"" the fundamentals. After that, documentation is much more understandable.

So I just wanted to share this with the community because I think it's awesome! And I hope others find it helpful.",26,125,vim-easy-align: the most ingenious plugin I've discovered in a while,vim

Eventually I think it would be cool to use this to write music instead of a DAW.  I'm looking into headless VST instrument racks and other music tech stuff to use with it to make this possible.

My usual reaction to that is to hit <esc> a couple of times hoping I won't break anything I was working on.

But a couple of minutes ago I was working on a somewhat repetitive task and my mind went to that 'recording' thing I had never really fully investigated what it does...

Let's google that:

So I hit **qa**.

'recording' appears at the bottom.

I perform all the steps of my repeating task.

I hit **q**, move to the next line, hit **@a**

OMG it did exactly what it said on the box! It applied all my recorded steps on the next line!
So I repeat this sequence of moving to the next line and hitting **@a** a couple of times when a thought occurred to me:

"Since this ended up way longer than expected...  
TL;DR: slammed face on keyboard to make macros, saved myself an hour or so of copy-pasting

---

So I thought I'd share this here, since I don't know who else to share it with.

Over the past couple days, I was asked to put in a bunch of logging calls for tracking statistics on CTR, etc. on a website.  The header alone has nearly 150 links in it (two hamburger menus of doom... shitty design, but not my problem).  I checked the format with my boss, then dumped it into a python script I wrote to generate all the log calls.  I pasted them into the .ftl file one by one, tested it on dev, stg, and prod00 (I don't actually know what the English name for this is.  Basically it's prod, but only deploys to an IP accessible in house.  You change the `hosts` file to point to it instead of live), and everything looked great.  Then I was told ""hey, actually, can you change some of these?""  Fack.

I was left with about 150 strings, most of which looked like

`amb-mine-click=""${tapContents('foo-bar-baz', '', content.qux!'')}`

That needed to be replaced with  

`amb-mine-click=""${tapContents('foo-bar-baz-qux', '', '')}`

Sometimes it was already

`amb-mine-click=""${tapContents('foo-bar-baz-qux', '', content.qux!'')}`

that just needed the last `content.qux!` taken out, sometimes they didn't need to be changed at all.  I couldn't think of any smart regex to do this for me, so I resigned to doing the first dozen or so by hand.  Then I remembered: vim has macros.  I closed eclipse, opened up the ftl file in one split, fired up my aforementioned python script and put the output in another split, then got to work delicately constructing the macros I'd need.

At first I just had one: `df}`, which I'd use to delete the old log call.  But then I learned the hard way that `yy` also copies the carriage return, so I made a second macro, `^y$`.  I used these two for a while, but then got a bit annoyed that I had to delete, change to my list of logs, copy the new one, change to the ftl, and paste it in.  But I couldn't start with the copy because `d` automatically cuts to the same register as `y`.

A little bit of stackoverflow-fu later, I came up with `""_df}P`, which cuts to the blackhole register, then pastes.  Awesome.  But this is still a lot of C-w C-w to change splits.  Macros became  `^y$C-wh` and `""_df}PC-wl` respectively.  But I still have to go to the next line in my list of new log calls, and the next log call in my ftl.  `/amb-mine` in the ftl file made it so that `n` automatically jumped to the next one, so my delete macro turned into `""_df}PnC-wl`, and my copy macro turned into `^y$jC-wh`.  

In the end, I was mildly amused at how much my macros looked like someone just slammed the keyboard with their face.  I had been showing a friend a while back the cool things you can do in vim, and now I could say ""Today I made two commands by typing `qw^y$jC-whq` and `qq""_df}PnC-wlq`, and it made my tedious job of copy and pasting 150 strings done in about a minute.""

Let's not talk about time spent on stackoverflow or making sure my macro worked.  I was proud of myself for using vim to do the boring stuff for me.",25,104,Vim eliminated so much tedium from my life today,vim

"Sorry for my poor English. But in the spirit of the Reddit posts recently about how great Tim Pope is... 

I would like to place another Vimplugin creator in spotlight. I'm impressed by the quality of the Vim plugins from [Shougo Matsushita](https://github.com/Shougo)

I use a lot of his plugins, so I started to notice that the plugins are very sophisticated.

For example, Ctrlp and Fuzzyfilefinder are by far one of the best/most popular plugins. So to be replacable is no easy feat. But I see more and more Vim developers are replacing their Ctrlp with Unite, created by Shougo. When I looked into the code, Unite uses [vimproc](https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim) (maintained by Shougo) too behind the scenes, which affords for searching/fuzzing while it asynchronous populates the file list in the background, whoa! 

And Unite detects if you're using grep, ack, or ag. If so, it will executes them too. And can buffer switching like LustyJuggler, and integrates your Git commands. So it's more all-in-one plugin combined. 

His another plugins are even more ingenious. For example, [Vim-shell](https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell.vim), a full fledged terminal in your Vim buffer, written in pure Vimscript, works like charm. It has
built-in functionalities to act same as zsh. So bash/Zsh like commands, like Git will work without any trouble in Vim-shell inside your Vim without the need to connect to external terminal. 

You can even connect with another plugin [SSH](https://github.com/Shougo/neossh.vim) inside Vim. 
Another example is [Vimfiler](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim), which is more powerful than the NERDTree, or Neocomplete which is fully written in Lua, to be faster than his Neocomplcache. 

Or manage all the plugins I named earlier with his another creation, [Neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) which I found truly better than Vundle. You have even the possibility to lazy update asynchronously.

Shougo writes his plugins for Windows environment, but he manually tests his plugins thourughly in different environments like Ubuntu, Fedora, Cygwin and even Solaris, before he makes it publicity. 

Whenever I open an issue about one of the plugins, I get always a direct response in some hours. But there is even more. For example, Tim Pope is an American. So reading latin characters like Vimscript would not be too hard. 

When I take a look at Shougo's Twitter:  https://twitter.com/ShougoMatsu, I see he writes mainly in Japanese. Imagine how hard this would be for Shougo. The Latin nature of Vim and coding in latin character. He write his documentation well in Japanese, English and even Mandarin, if I'm not wrong. 

When I asked of I could donate some bitcoins for his tremendous work, he declined my offer. He just don't want anything, but more help to expand the Vim scripts for everyone would be welcome. 


**TDLR;** Look at the different purposes of his plugins, and how easily they could contest many popular Vim plugins from many different Vim developers... all from *one* person.... I must admit, this guy is awesome!

"Hugely useful when dealing with multiple vim/neovim instances running between different terminal tabs, or just when trying to copy something in a vim instance which is split into panes.

Explanation:

- `""` tells vim to copy data to a register

- `*` is the system-wide register, AKA the clipboard

- `y` is the yank command

This makes it easy to `Ctrl+p` or `Cmd+p` your selection into another file. Alternatively, you can use `""*p` for pasting from the system-wide clipboard.

EDIT: as pointed out by /u/Grisk13, OS X's default vim doesn't ship with this feature for some reason.

"Getting the window layout you want can be a bit frustrating sometimes.

One reason for this is that vim does not offer many ways to move windows
around.  `:wincmd H`, `:wincmd J`, etc., are useful but only work when
you want to move a window to the far left, bottom, etc.  It is also very
difficult to ""convert"" a horizontal split into a vertical one when there are more
than two windows.

Take the following example:
 
    +-------------+-------+-------+           +-----------------+-----------+
    |             |       |       |           |                 |           |

    | current win |       |       |           |                 |           |
    |             |       |       | ctrl-w gj |                 |           |
    |             |       |       |           |                 |           |
    +-------------+-------+-------+           +-------------+---+-----------+
    |                             | +-------> |             |               |
    |                             |           | current win |               |
    |                             |           |             |               |
    +-----------------------------+           +-------------+---------------+

Going from the first layout to the second would normally would require you to
move to the window below, vsplit it, open the correct buffer, and then finally
close the original window.  That's what this plugin does in one command.

https://github.com/andymass/vim-tradewinds

This is a pretty simple plugin.  There are only four maps:

    <c-w>gh: soft move left
    <c-w>gj: soft move down
    <c-w>gk: soft move up
    <c-w>gl: soft move right

Each can be summarized as follows: move the cursor to the window
in given direction, make a split (vertical if moving up/down and horizontal if left/right),
edit the buffer form the previous window, and close the previous window.

This sounds a bit unintuitive at first, but is actually very natural after you start using it. 
There's also some logic to determine whether to make splits left/above or
right/below which tries to make moves as frictionless as possible.

Unfortunately, the plugin isn't perfect as it's only _emulating_ moving windows.
Opening and closing windows and switching buffers can have any number of
horrible side effects.

This would be much better built into vim-

## As a vanilla command

So, I [wrote a patch](https://github.com/andymass/vim/commit/54ae8fe2ca1b7e7012f235c6e09e34fb22ce4952)

the Ctrl-w HJKL movements.  I'm hoping to see if there's some interest before submitting it.

That post describes a Vim command that executes another command in all lines that matches the given expression:   g/<expression>/<command>

The fact is that this is not a Vim exclusive.  It wasn't even new in Vi.  It's an ancient Ed command that people used a lot to print all lines containing a regex.  (Remember that Ed was a line editor -non visual- and people needed to print parts of the buffer all the time).

Back then it was known as:

:g/<re>/p

""g"" for global search (""global"" for all buffer, in contrast to ""current line""), p for print, and <re> for Regular Expression.

1. [vim-subversive](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-subversive) - Adds two operator motions to quickly replace text.  The first is pretty basic and just replaces the given text object with the given register.  The second is more interesting because you can specify both the text to replace and the range of lines to replace the text over by providing two text objects (see the gifs for how this actually looks in practice)

2. [vim-yoink](https://github.com/svermeulen/vim-yoink) - Automatically stores a history of yanks and allows cycling between them after a paste.  Similar to Yankring or miniyank if you know those

\- [One dark theme](https://github.com/rakr/vim-one), this is probably the most popular colorscheme for all tools, but I don't like it because it's so mainstream and therefore doesn't have anything special.

\- [Material](https://github.com/jdkanani/vim-material-theme), I used to be a fan of this theme when I still use Sublime, but then got bored because of its blue-green color or whatever the hell you call it.

"[match-up](https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup) provides motions
between matching words like if/else/endif (`%`, `g%`, `]%`, `[%`),
corresponding text-objects (`a%`, `i%`), and general highlighting between
matching words.  Vim's standard matchparen only supports highlighting of
single characters `(),{},[]`, but with match-up anything that can be
navigated with `%` will be highlighted ([screen animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/andymass/vim-matchup/images/match-up-hl1.gif)).
It will also display matches which are outside the extents of the screen
in the status line, which turns out to be surprisingly helpful when
dealing with large code blocks.

If you have used matchit, the motions `%` and `g%` should be familiar.
The other motions and text objects were partially implemented by matchit,
but it did not handle many cases correctly (this is pretty tricky to do
with counts, operators, repetition, etc.), and has suffered some bit-rot
with newer vim versions.  match-up is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for the old matchit plugin and it should already work with any language
supported by matchit through `b:match_words`, although it has only been
thoroughly tested by me with vim script.  The eventual goal is to support
even languages which don't use matching words (like python).

match-up requires a fairly new version of vim (needs `reltime()`), and it
will be a bit slower than the old plugins because it is doing a lot more.
I would be happy to receive any feedback regarding performance or anything
else.

"I'm just wondering what the community at large feels about NeoVim.

When it was first announced I was a little bit skeptical, along the lines of Bram's thinking, I thought it was a noble task that would be to big of a task and would fizzle out after 12 months. 

Now, I'm not so sure, it seems to be gaining traction and mindshare and progress seems to be good and the promise of new language  interfaces appears to be bearing fruit. 

I'm wondering what Bram feels about this really, he seems rather skeptical and he's either right to be because he's wise (which seems likely) or he's wrong because too invested in the current code base and he's not willing to participate in this reboot (which seems possible).

For example, one of the arguments against NeoVim is dropping support for certain systems. I think it's a shame to lose that support, but the existing Vi/Vim code bases aren't going anywhere and NeoVim will cover the ""main"" operating systems, so if it's a case of holding NeoVim back, then I think we can and should lose that support. 

Basically, I originally thought this would be a flash in the pan, but now I'm wondering if it will become the de facto Vim. What are your thoughts? Do you think it will replace Vim? Do you want it to succeed? Do you think it will fizzle out?",89,87,What's the word on the street about NeoVim?,vim

"Much of the success and popularity of vim-airline can be attributed to powerline, which paved the way for making the statusline vibrant and full of information, and I owe much thanks to Lokaltog for such a brilliant idea.

Many of the features of vim-airline piggyback on things exposed by other plugins, like the tagbar extension which displays which function the cursor is in (useful when you work on project with 1000+ line functions).

Today, I'd like to announce a completely original idea: [a smart tab line](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/tree/dev#smarter-tab-line).  

This resolves the age-old question of how does Vim work with buffers and tabs.  I hope you guys like it!  :-)",70,89,A vim-airline original feature: smarter tab line,vim

"I was looking for how to replicate external editing in vim.  Found the plugin vim-ghost and decided to try it.

The problem is that it depends on a direct (not pypi hosted) install from github of this: `https://github.com/dpallot/simple-websocket-server`

Right, that's strange, but I have a safe-ish firewalled area to test it in.

The first thing I noticed is that simply importing that SimpleWebSocketServer immediately opened an https server publically.

    from .SimpleWebSocketServer import *

And one of those imports is `SimpleHTTPSServer.py`:


    '''

    import BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer
    import ssl

    # openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.pem
    httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 443), SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
    httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True, certfile='./cert.pem', keyfile='./cert.pem', ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)
    httpd.serve_forever()

I changed it to this, just to test the plugin (which I'm using right now).

    '''

    import BaseHTTPServer, SimpleHTTPServer
    import ssl

    # openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.pem
    # no no no no do not do this
    # httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('127.0.0.1', 443), SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
    # httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True, certfile='./cert.pem', keyfile='./cert.pem', ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)
    # httpd.serve_forever()

    def getSimpleHttpServer():
        httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('127.0.0.1', 443), SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)
        httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True, certfile='./cert.pem', keyfile='./cert.pem', ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)
        httpd.serve_forever()

Even so, I still got the firewall warning with a pseudo-random port.  So I took a look at vim-ghost.

In `ghost.py` (under rplugin/python3) lines `94-110`:

    @neovim.command('GhostStart', range='', nargs='0')
    def server_start(self, args, range):
        if self.server_started:
            self.nvim.command(""echo 'Ghost server already running on port %d'""
                              % self.port)
            logger.info(""server already running on port %d"", self.port)
            return

        if self.nvim.funcs.exists(""g:ghost_port"") == 1:
            self.port = self.nvim.api.get_var(""ghost_port"")
        else:
            self.nvim.api.set_var(""ghost_port"", self.port)

        self.httpserver = MyHTTPServer(self, ('', self.port),
                                       WebRequestHandler)
        http_server_thread = Thread(target=self.httpserver.serve_forever,
                                    daemon=True)

Again, unless you intend to let people on other machines edit your reddit posts in McDonald's or Starbucks, you really do not want top open a public web socket.  I'm not sure how windows does it, but if you open an unbound socket and don't allow it with the firwall, it blocks it for localhost as well.  That means it's either insecure, or will not work.  That's probably not a good idea.

I changed the code on my copy (that I'm using now) like so: (and got rid of that pesky firewall warning for Python.app)

    @neovim.command('GhostStart', range='', nargs='0')
    def server_start(self, args, range):
        if self.server_started:
            self.nvim.command(""echo 'Ghost server already running on port %d'""
                              % self.port)
            logger.info(""server already running on port %d"", self.port)
            return

        if self.nvim.funcs.exists(""g:ghost_port"") == 1:
            self.port = self.nvim.api.get_var(""ghost_port"")
        else:
            self.nvim.api.set_var(""ghost_port"", self.port)

        self.httpserver = MyHTTPServer(self, ('127.0.0.1', self.port),
                                       WebRequestHandler)
        http_server_thread = Thread(target=self.httpserver.serve_forever,

In my day-to-day work I have to switch between psql and Vim and I thought: 'Ok, isnt't it nice to have a way to execute queries to the DB directly from Vim?'. I searched around for similar solutions, but I didn't feel that they are my thing. And this is how the vim-pg plugin was born. So basically, it's a wrapper around PostgreSQL's psql and it sends visual selection directly to the DB, returning a result in another split. Now I'm using this small thingy in my work and I'm pretty happy with it. This is the repo: [https://github.com/vpenkoff/vim-pg](https://github.com/vpenkoff/vim-pg)

"I learned about [anonymous snippets in UltiSnips](https://www.sirver.net/blog/2011/07/26/anonymous-snippets-in-ultisnips/) and it inspired me to write snippets at home, as a hobby. For those who don't know, [UltiSnips is a snippet plugin](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) and an anonymous snippet is a string of text that you can build dynamically and then send to UltiSnips. The result gets inserted directly into Vim. Since it's all just strings, you can get pretty fancy with it.

&nbsp;


Here are videos of my top 3 snippets:


**Automatic docstrings**

https://asciinema.org/a/192305

Once you're done writing a function, a docstring can be generated using the function body, as reference. This one's unexpectedly a huge time-saver on big projects.

I implemented it for Google-style, Numpy, Sphinx, and Epydoc style. Any style could be supported without that much effort though.


**Function auto-completion**

https://asciinema.org/a/192301

It's simple. Start writing a function, wait a fraction of a second and UltSnips will auto-fill all the args in for you. It requires jedi-vim and UltiSnips though.

I saw someone do this using OmniSharp and thought ""Dope, can I do that?"". Turns out, the answer is ""Yes! Easily!""


**Dunder methods**

https://asciinema.org/a/192306

PyCharm and Sublime both have this feature so I figured I'd bring it to Vim, using UltiSnips. To be honest this didn't need to ""auto-generated"" but it was a good first test for using anonymous snippets.

&nbsp;


As you can see, UltiSnips is awesome.

"I've been a sublime-text fan for a little over a year. It was my first Python IDE / Editor, and I loved it. I kept on hearing people talk about vim, and it looked interesting. Since I do freelance work, it doesn't matter if I take a few days off to learn something (like Vim), especially if it'll make me faster in the long run. So, over the past few days, I've been learning Vim. Here's some stuff I found out about:


Many people (including me) used their old text-editors like Notepad with syntax highlighting. Vim forces you to use commands, and these commands make you way faster than when using Notepad with syntax-highlighting. When learning vim, learn the **very basics**, and then find some small commands that'll increase your productivity a-lot versus your previous editor. This will let you start working faster right away, and keep you coming back to vim. For me, it was ""change inner [something]"", or ci[something]. This finds the next two [something] characters, removes the text between them, and then puts your cursor between them in insert mode. O, o, and a are also really great.


Don't use the arrow keys. It's really not hard to start using hjkl, and it's great when you just need to move your cursor a little bit. I used to hate having to reach for my mouse or the arrow keys whenever I had to move my cursor only a few characters.


If you're using whitespace properly, { and } are pretty great. They'll jump to the next ""paragraph"", or section of text surrounded by whitespace. Great for quickly skipping through some functions or class definitions.


Find, at max, five plugins for your first week. You don't want to load up vim with a bunch of plugins you barely use. Find a few that are really good and learn how to use them well. For me, so far, I've been using:

* [Supertab!](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab)
* [Transparency Windows!](https://github.com/mattn/transparency-windows-vim)
* [Vim-Airline!](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
* [Vim Multiple Cursors!](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)


Don't use Nerdtree. [Use netrw. It does everything NerdTree does, and it's already in vim.](https://medium.com/@mozhuuuuu/vimmers-you-dont-need-nerdtree-18f627b561c3) Really though, [you should be using buffers.](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_buffer_FAQ)


Get a nice colorscheme, and a vim cheatsheet. I use [monokai](https://github.com/lsdr/monokai) and [this cheatsheet wallpaper.](https://github.com/LevelbossMike/vim_shortcut_wallpaper) If you use a wallpaper like that, set it as your desktop background and set your vim transparency to 15 (you might need a plugin for this, like I did).

"Two years ago today, I purchased a copy of Sublime Text 2. I paid $70 for it and
could not have been happier. It was fast. It was pretty. It had tons of
extensions. It ran on every OS so I could use it at home on my Mac, at school on
Linux, and at work on Windows.

Fast forward to last week. I just started a new job and recieved a shiny new
MacBook. I promptly installed Sublime on it and got to reinstalling my plugins.
I was unable to get several of them to work which was frustrating. SublimeLinter
in particular was annoying. Development of the SublimeLinter plugin for ST2 had
stopped some time ago, and still had some obvious bugs in it, which were never
going to be fixed since the developers had already abandoned it for the new
SublimeLinter3.

The whole ecosystem for Sublime feels like it's falling apart. People have ditched
development for ST2 in favor of ST3 which is still in beta. Speaking of ST3, the
last dev build was way back in May, and apparently progress had been stagnating
even before then. Then theres a long period of silence until two weeks ago when
someone posts to /r/programming [""Proof Sublime Text is still
alive""](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2bhczt/proof_sublime_text_is_still_alive/).
Still no details on when things will be picking back up. Plugin development is
hard because the API is not really well documented. It's also closed source
which doesn't help the rate of development.

People kept telling me how awesome Vim is so I thought ""what the hell, let's
give it a go"". I spent this weekend finding alternatives to the Sublime plugins
I use, setting up a good `.vimrc` and learning some basic commands. I thought it
would be hard remembering all the commands, but once I got started, I realized
that was a load of crap. Now that I started with an open mind and put some
effort and time into learning it, I think it makes MORE sense than common editor
keyboard shortcuts. Like, why the hell does EVERYTHING in Sublime live under Cmd
+ P?

Anyways, I'm going to try to spend this next week Sublime free. Wish me luck!

For instance:

* `ea` to append to a word
* `xp` to swap characters
* `ddp` to swap two lines
* `gg=G` to indent the file
* `%cib` to change inside next parentheses block (if at beginning of line)
* `*cw`, followed by multiple `n.` to change occurences of word under character (imo much easier than `:%s/REGEX/g` as long as the word doesn't occur very often)
* `%%w` to land inside the next parentheses (if at beginning of line), followed by whatever. I usually do this to land inside the parameter definition of a method and follow it up with something like `dw.` if I want to delete the first parameter, `cW` if I want to change it etc.

You can commit these logical commands to muscle memory just like ordinary commands - when I ""wanna change that first argument"" I automatically do `%%wcw` without having to think.

"Since I have some free time to kill (aka I'm procrastinating), I've decided to write a quick introduction to vimrcs for beginners to Vim, in hopes that it will cause less frustration for those newer to the language. I find vimscript a very deeply flawed language, and there are many beginner traps that I once fell into. So instead of talking about what works, I'm going to talk about what doesn't work, aka what to look out for.

Note that this is a primer for vimrcs, not vimscripting. Strictly speaking there is no difference, but I find that in practice vimrcs use a much much smaller subset of vimscript, and generally vimrcs are mostly composed of simple syntactical structures.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

**Introduction: What is a vimrc?**

A vimrc is the configuration file for vim. When Vim starts up, it reads all configurations from the vimrc, so that you do not have to type them every single time. It is usually in the $HOME$ directory, and in Unix(-like) systems, it has the name '.vimrc' (without quotes), while in Windows systems, it has the name '_vimrc' (without quotes). 

The language for the vimrc is vimscript. While you could infect other languages into your vimrc through the ruby or python commands, it also depends on whether your version of Vim supports it or not. However, other languages in vimscripts are way beyond the scope of this post.

Vimscript is primarily composed of ex commands. They are the commands that you type when you type ':' on the keyboard to go to 'command line mode'. What this means is the examples below can also be entered into Vim by prefixing it with ':', and postfixing it with '<CR>' (carriage return, in modern keyboards it is the Enter key) to confirm. However, very few commands must be used in vimscripts, and is unavailable in command line mode, but we will not discuss them.

**The basics**

I find that generally, most vimrcs are composed almost entirely of 4 syntactical structures: comments, sets, maps, and lets. I find this behavior so common that when I completely refactored my vimrc a few months ago, I split the vimrc into multiple files, and there is one file exclusively for sets, and another file exclusively for maps.

To begin, we will talk about comments.

**Comments**  

Structure:

    "" Comment

The general format of a comment is a quotation mark(double), followed by the content of the comment. Like most languages, comments will not be run, and are there solely for annotations. Everything succeeded by the "" will be treated as a comment, *generally speaking*. 

While it may seem to be very simple, there are still many things that could go wrong. However, it is much harder to explain in this section. The general rule of thumb is:

*Always put comments on their own line.*

While it is still okay in many cases to put comments after vimscript commands, I generally recommend not doing so, due to many potential traps.

The second rule is:

*Never have another quotation mark(double) after the first quotation mark(double) for comments.*

Again, I will explain this in another section.

**sets**

In order to modify *options* in Vim, we have to use the set command. Note that set does **not** modify *variables*. They are very different concepts in Vim.

To query for the value of an option in Vim, you would use:

    set <optionname>?

as an ex command. For example, if you open Vim, and type:

   :set hlsearch?<CR>

It will show you the value of the option 'hlsearch'. Generally, there is no point in doing this within vimscripts.

I tend to think about options as having two categories: boolean options, and nonboolean options. They have very different syntax. You can use vimdoc to check the type of the option (:h '<optionname>').

**The easy case: boolean options**

To enable an option, 

Structure:

    set <optionname>

Easy peasy. For example, if you put:

    set hlsearch

in your vimrc, the option 'hlsearch' (highlight matching search) will be enabled by default.

If you find the 'hlsearch' option annoying like me, you can disable the option. It looks like,

Structure:

    set no<option>

For example, I have:

    set nohlsearch

in my vimrc. This disables 'hlsearch' on start.

What this implies is that for easier parsing, option names in Vim should not start with 'no'. This is, as far as I know, true (thankfully).

That's the good part. Now onto the bad part.

**The bad case: nonboolean options**

Unlike boolean options, nonboolean options always require a value. Hence, it looks like:

Structure:

    set <option>=<value> 

For example, in my vimrc, I have

    set winwidth=79

Which sets the window width to 79 by default.

Sometimes you might want to leave an option with no value, usually either to resort to its default behavior, or to some setting specified by vimdoc. For instance, in an older version of Vim (note that the newest version changed this behavior, that actually confused me when I'm writing this), I want to default 'K' to open vimdoc instead of manpages. Hence, I have:

    set manprg=

This leaves the option with no value. 

Now, onto the bad parts. The first gotcha is the 'Space' gotcha, which stumped me when I first modified my vimrc. If you have a C-style inclination, you may be tempted to write something like this:

    set winwidth = 79

Generally, Vim should throw out an error at this point (thankfully). 

*This does not work!*. To understand why, you need to know that set commands actually have a syntax more consistent to:

Structure:

    set <option1> <option2> ....

For example, I can,

    set splitbelow splitright

to set *both* 'splitbelow' and 'splitright', two boolean options.

Hence, if you do,

    set winwidth = 79

Vim parses it as: set the boolean options 'winwidth', '=', and '79'. For me, it throws out the error '79 option not found'. However, if you wrote something like

    set winwidth =

You may not be so fortunate... It doesn't do what you intended to do, and doesn't throw out an error.

The second most common gotcha is the 'string' gotcha. It is also a mistake when I made, due to knowing C. Suppose that you are setting an option of type string, say, the 'omnifunc' option:

    set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete

This is the correct syntax. If you write something like this:

    set omnifunc='syntaxcomplete#Complete'

Surprisingly, it works, but sometimes! I recall using a version that does not. Do not rely on that.

The worst case is something like this:

    set omnifunc=""syntaxcomplete#Complete""

with double quotes. Does it work? The answer is **sometimes** (in vimscript, maybe in command line mode). Never rely on this behavior! In some previous version, it correctly recognized the string. HOWEVER, "" also denotes the start of the comment. For this reason, never put comments on the same line on commands! The "" is a poor choice for a comment delimiter.

Hence, one important rule of thumb for sets is: *Always follow the exact format!*. Don't put unnecessary spaces, and no quotation marks.

**maps**

I find the syntax for maps even worse than sets, as it is way too hard to figure out what went wrong. I'm sure there are more gotchas for maps, and I'm only going to cover the basic ones. Leave a comment below if you know of others, and I'll put it up :-).

Map commands map certain keystrokes to another... the idea is simple. For clarity, I will denote a mapping from <keystrokes1> to <keystrokes2> as:

    <keystrokes1> --> <keystrokes2>

For example, if I have a mapping that when I press the z key on the keyboard, Vim executes the command for the x key instead, I would denote it as:

    z --> x

(Please don't actually do this).

The syntax *seems* very straightforward:

Structure:

    <maptype> <keystrokes1> <keystrokes2>

results in <keystrokes1> --> <keystrokes2> under <maptype>.

So what is a <maptype>? It is specifier for a type of mapping. Some mappings you only want to work on normal mode, while some mappings you want to work under, say, visual mode. For this reason, I highly recommend specifying exactly which maps work under which mode: odds are, you probably have most mappings work under normal and visual modes, and probably way less mappings under insert mode.

The second problem about mappings is which functionality do you want to use. For example, sometimes you want to swap the functionality of two keys, say, the 1 key and the ! key. So it would look something like this:

    1 --> !
    ! --> 1

The most obvious problem is: when I perform the second map, should ! take on the functionality of the ""remapped"" 1, or the functionality of the 1 key by Vim defaults? In this case, we want the default behavior of 1, not our remapped behavior. Hence, this is the problem of whether we want a ""recursive"" mapping (to what has already mapped) or not.

To address these two problems, here are the command names for <maptype>:

Structure:

    <mode><recursive?>map

<mode> is which mode you want the mapping to work in. They are all one character:

* n -- normal mode (most commonly seen)
* v -- visual mode (second most commonly seen)
* c -- command line mode
* i -- insert mode
* <none> (aka type nothing) -- all modes, you probably don't want that

<recursive?> is simply either nothing (omitted), or the characters 'nore'. If it is nothing (omitted), it triggers recursive mapping. If it has the characters 'nore', it triggers nonrecursive (default Vim behavior) mapping.

For example, I have:

    vnoremap <C-j> <C-n>

This triggers a nonrecursive (mapping to default Vim), mapping that works only under visual mode, <C-j> --> <C-n>. Hence, it maps <C-j> to the default behavior of <C-n>, which is ""next completion"". My mappings for <C-n> (if I have any), will not affect the mapping for <C-j>.

On the other hand, I have:

    nmap <leader>e :edit %%

This triggers a recursive (mapping to my own mapping) mapping that works only under normal mode, <leader>e --> :edit %%. The reason that in this case I want a recursive mapping, is that I have another cnoremap from %%, that uses some register = magic to provide the path to the directory of the current path. Hence, I do want %% to expand to my current path, which is convenient.

Another way to think about it is that recursive mappings, like that one above, basically types out the mapping literally. Hence, when I type <leader>e, Vim literally helps me type out :edit %%. When it is typing out %%, it realises that %% has another mapping that expands the current filepath, and hence it triggers the functionality of %% too.

One thing to note is that I highly recommend checking if your mapping *intends* to map to Vim's default behavior or not. If that is the case, always put 'nore', so you will never have to worry about other mappings breaking this previous mapping.

And now, onto the bad parts of maps.

As stated above, the map command takes the form of:

    <maptype> <keystrokes1> <keystrokes2>

The parts of the command is delimited by a single space. In retrospect, this may not seem like a great idea. Consider this:

    nnoremap <leader>  <C-^>
            ^        ^^
The most obvious question to ask here is: which one is the second space? This is syntatic ambiguity. 

Am I mapping:

    <leader> --> <Space><C-^>

or,

    <leader><Space> --> <C-^>

It is not at all obvious! I'm not exactly sure how it behaves (I believe it maps <leader> --> <Space><C-^>, correct me if I'm wrong). Either way, *never* rely on this behavior! When you are writing maps that involves spaces, *always* explicitly specify them. For example:

    nnoremap <leader><Space> <C-^>

to map:

    <leader><Space> --> <C-^>

However, one behavior that appears to be consistent, is that after reading the second space, all spaces after that will be treated as a single literal <Space>. Hence I can write:

    nmap <leader>e :edit %%

which maps:

    <leader>e --> :edit<Space>%%

Always do this with caution!.

This brings us to the second trap: the comment trap. This is the most deadly trap in vimrcs, since oftentimes, even though the syntax is incorrect for the intention, it still works! To illustrate this, consider what the example above implies. A moment's realisation should be that putting a Space after the keystrokes for the target mapping, doesn't make you safe!

Consider this:

    nmap <leader>e :edit %% "" Quickly open current directory files

I have put what appears to be a comment after the nmap. However, notice that since the Space after "":edit"" is treated as a literal <Space>, the space after the ""%%"" should be treated as the literal <Space> as well! Hence, the mapping doesn't end there. Vim will still type all of the subsequent characters out.

This is one of the luckier examples, since if you put this in your vimrc and give it a run, you'll notice immediately that there are way too many characters. However, consider another example:

    nnoremap <C-j> o<Esc>S<Esc>k "" Insert empty line after

The million dollar question is: will this work as expected? The answer is, unfortunately, **yes**, but for all the wrong reasons.

So why will this work? Shouldn't Vim continue to type the rest of the characters out for you? 

Answer is: *Yes*, that is exactly what it does. However, consider what happens when you type out '"" '. "" is the specify register command. Hence, '"" ' specifies the register <Space>, a register that does not exist in Vim! At this point, Vim resorts to its what I like to call *default termination behavior* (I call it that primarily because this behavior is very often abused in macros, to control macro termination). *default termination behavior* is that in the event that you are *running* a *series* of keystrokes by a *nonexplicit call* (through maps or macros or :norm, generally), whenever Vim encouters an error, it will halt the run of the current keystrokes immediately. What this means is that since '"" ' encounters an error, it will *not* continue to run the keystrokes after that, namely 'Insert empty line after'.

This is the *main* reason why a lot of bad vimrcs out there can put what appears to be comments after a map, and still get away with it! However, the syntax is still incorrect according to intention. Hence the rule:

*Never put comments on the same line as a map.*

Or generally:

*Always put comments on its own line*

That's the fool-proof way.

**lets**

The [FastFold plugin](https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold) makes it so folds are only recalculated on save (so you're always using `foldmethod=manual` -- but the folds are calculated with `foldmethod=syntax` or whatever you had set before).

This solved the problem for me. Now I can use compl-whole-line completion in my 5000 line C++ file and it's instant and snappy instead of taking minutes and unresponsive.

"So, I started off using Vim solely for natural language processing. I kinda hate configuration files, and the autocomplete options looked a bit complicated, so I figured I'd stick with VSCode for programming.

A month passed, and I found that I don't really enjoy writing text outside of Vim anymore. It just seems so... lifeless. So I downloaded the Vim-for-VSCode extension, which promised to give you the full Vim experience, except in VSCode. 

Except, it's not quite. For example, I don't like using the escape key. In Vim, I can always Ctrl-C out of anything. In VSCode, all my fiddling around with the (vile) configuration files couldn't make that possible. Another example. I don't like scrollbars. I don't see why they exist in the days of two-finger-scroll. Plus, I have shitty eyesight, so I'm really stingy about screenspace. But, you can't get rid of them in VSCode. There are loads of tiny examples like that.

So VSCode for Vim is good, but for any number of small reasons, it just doesn't feel right. You can't hop around buffers. You can't set it up so you have fuzzy search for everything. Whatever you do to it, VSCode just doesn't have that special feel.

So I started trying to get Vim to behave like an IDE. I got YouCompleteMe, and Syntastic, and Ultisnips, and I spent about a day dickering around with various settings to get them halfway working - and well, I've started coding in Vim.

Except, the problem is, YouCompleteMe, while good, isn't nearly as nice as VSCode's default auto-completion. Equally, Syntastic is really nice - but it's not as good as VSCode's system.  Is there any way to set up Vim so you get the modern IDE experience? ",86,73,Leaving Vim,vim

So I think I need to use tabs, panes, etc. for a single instance of vim to edit multiple files more efficiently where their buffers are shared.

P.S. If I open multiple files to edit via `vim <file1> <file2> <file3>`, I can use `:next` and `:previous` to navigate between these files.

Most of the information below (along with more beginner info) can be found in `:help help-summary`.

Vim's help is accessible through the built-in command `:help` (and can be searched with `:helpgrep`).

Tab completion with the right prefixes makes it pretty quick to find what you're looking for if you already know something about the command:

* `:` is used for cmdline/Ex-mode commands (`:help :help`) 
* `'` is used for options (`:help 'incsearch'`)
* No prefix for normal mode commands (`:help CTRL-]`)
* `i_` for insert mode (`:help i_CTRL-[`)
* `v_` for visual mode (`:help v_CTRL-]`)

When editing vimscript, you can use `K` to look up help for the keyword under the cursor. tpope's [vim-scriptease](https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease) has an improved `K` that figures out the type of command from the context (to differentiate `:call` from `call()`).

"EDIT: sorry I'm not a native English speaker, so I didn't make myself clear, from one reply I figured out that what I'm looking for is not ""combo"" but ""idioms"", of cause VIM is a language of editing text,  it has full of combos but there are some combos that are not very obvious but still very useful. Like one I have just learnt from this thread that >} is an idiom for indent lines from current line to the next empty line. Usually I just do Vjjjj> which is less effective. I hope this example can make this thread more focus on idioms, not just listing text objects like caw or yib. Thank you.  :EDIT DONE 

I've used vim a few years, on the very first day I already learnt `ddp` is the combination for swap two lines, but after many months of using vim, I eventually learnt from one's blog that `xp` is actually a short phrase for swapping two characters. I was shocked by the fact that such a simple but useful combination was not discovered by myself in the first few weeks. Now I would like to collect some really simple, concise, but life changing commands. These commands must be very simple, and can solve a common editing (programming) task like swapping characters.

I would start from my collection:

* **xp**, swap two characters.

* **vaBV**, if your cursor is in a {} block and you want to effectively select the block including the whole line before the {. Only works if your coding style does not put the left { in a new line.

* **V$%**, if your cursor is on the function name, and want to effectively select the whole function. I like this one is because $ and % are next to each other and all three need to hold Shift key, very easy to press. Again, if you put the left { in a new line, then you need to use Vj% which is harder to press, because you need to hold the shift, release it, then hold it again.

* This one does not qualify my request, as it needs key bindings and plugin to work, but I use it so many times a day, worth to mention here. 

    nmap zz yygccp
    
    vmap zz V&amp;lt;Esc>gvygvgc`>p

Above two lines map **zz** to quick refactor, it duplicates your current line, and marks the first line as comment so that you can quick do some tests without losing your work. This mapping needs support from [tpope/vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) as it gives you **gcc** to comment out current line.

If I have to do several replacements, I'll usually open the file up in Atom and do it there. I feel like I really need to get over this.

"I just saw this thread about the [set paste option](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3a9vji/if_vim_keeps_screwing_up_your_indentation_when/) and the countless solutions for correctly pasting stuff in vim. Since nobody mentioned ""set clipboard"" and it does not only help with pasting I figured I should make this post.

What

    :set clipboard^=unnamed ""adds unnamed to existing values

does is that the register you use for yanking and pasting when you don't specify one becomes the system clipboard '*'. So when you need to paste something into vim you just select it, switch to vim, press p, done, no indentation mess either. But it also works the other way round, you can yank something and paste with middle click in your system. You can also set it to unnamedplus instead which will use the '+' register (On Linux this would be the Ctrl+C/V instead of select/middleclick then). unnamedplus needs X11 support of course. I never tried this but you can also set both, which should yank to both clipboards from vim and paste from the clipboard that was used last in the system.

The downside of this is of course that maybe you do not want vim to override your system clipboard, but I don't mind it. Also i find it very useful that you can now yank something in vim and paste it in another vim that is running in a different terminal or even a in an ssh session.

I just thought I would share this since it's a lot simpler than every other option that uses the registers. If you are on a server and you can't forward your clipboard this won't work of course but the other register solutions won't either and you'll have to use :set paste anyway.",31,66,PSA: set clipboard=unnamed,vim

This tip is how to speed up editing of your complex ex commands or / searches.

q/ does the same for / searches. So if you entered long complicated regular expression, you can now edit it faster using all vim's might :D.

I was applying for jobs and the C# shops that I interviewed with thought it was weird that I don't use VisualStudio. They felt that I was resistant to IDEs but I assured them that that wasn't the case. The truth is I've never felt the need to change my workflow.

Anyways, I accepted a position at a mid-size tech company with a polyglot stack. They use Java, Ruby, Python, PHP (unfortunately) and a few other languages. I'm not entirely sure which languages I'll be working with (most likely Java and Ruby at the very least) but is vim a ""good"" editor for Java?

I would naturally use vim with Java if I needed to write code right now but I'm not sure if I'm better off opting for an IDE. This is my first software engineering position so I'm not really sure what everyone uses in the industry.

EDIT: Just for clarity. I have a pretty extensive vimrc and tmux configs. I use ale (linting), neocomplete (autocomplete), and a bunch of plugins and linux utilities. I also use i3+Tmux so I can search and run files pretty quickly. My Vim+i3+Tmux setup is IDE-like, I guess.

"The other day I stumbled across ""easy mode"". start vim with a '-y' argument. You are put in insert mode automatically, and escape does not get you out. So ironically easy mode is even harder to quit than normal. I had to force kill it the first time, then after some googling, discovered ctrl-l gets you into normal mode. 

There is very little info about this mode or why it exists. The help section is just a short paragraph. It seems useless because you still need normal mode to save or anything. My best guess is it's intended to be used with a gui. I tried it with macvim, and there I'm able to save, undo, with command-w and z, like a more modern editor.

"Hey /r/vim.
I was wondering if there's anyone out there that is doing all their work remotely using vim/ssh? If so, what's your workflow? I'm thinking large-ish apps in C#/Java(Maven?)/C++, and also python/haskell/c/obj-c/...

The reason I'm asking is that since my laptop has started to die I was thinking that, rather than replace it, I could host my projects on a server at my college. Then I can just ssh in from the various computers around campus and continue whenever in a tmux session.

My laptop weighs a tonne too (It's a 17"" behemoth from 2011), and carting it in and out every morning hasn't been super fun.

I wouldn't be able to install anything on the local college computers, since the user sessions are wiped as soon as you log out. Ssh/vim/tmux is about as good of a development environment I could get remotely(?). I can install whatever on the server however, and the terminals on the college computers are full colour (Osx..) so that's not an issue either.

Any tips/ ideas/ thoughts? Maybe I should just bite the bullet and invest in a new laptop, but doing everything remotely could be so handy. I haven't heard much of anyone doing heaver Java/C# stuff in vim at all though (Possibly because of the pretty strong Visual Studio/ Intellij vim emulation plugins), so I'm not sure it's possible to have a setup ~~in vim~~ in terminal that can rival an IDE right now...

"I am a screenwriter. I write my drafts on a typewriter. A bulky draft is now ready to go digital. I am using Scrivener to collate, arrange and organise text for a first draft.

Before going manual I invested months toying with almost all text editors/processors, including emacs. Yes, I did compare it with Vim, and also Sublime Text.

I quit emacs not only because of the learning curve but also because I wasn't able to configure it to my use(learning curve infinite loop). I am writing here because I use Vimium for Chrome. Having hovered over Vim features today, I find them if not easy, at least simple.

I am not a programmer. I do plan to learn, considering I find a platform to work on and build my configuration:

* Spell-check: I write a second language in roman script. I'd like to be able to build a spell-checker based on a roman dictionary of my second language. 

* Auto-completion: Ability to train and add personal keywords. Such as t+space is always the. th+space is always that. Merge auto-completion with personal spell-checker. 

* Dictionary: Access multiple dictionaries at once. Oxford, Cambridge, American Oxford and so on. Build personal dictionary. Rhyming dictionary too. 

* Thesaurus: Same as dictionary. Add multiple sources. If one doesn't exist, I'd like to build one up from ground up. If Roget's isn't available I'd want to be able to configure it myself. 

* Word List: Lets take Verbs. Screenwriting is verb writing. One is bound to obsess over verbs. Say you have a master files of all verbs in the dictionary. I'd like to tag and build this library into say dynamic verbs, sense verbs and so on.  

* Grammar: Ability to highlight parts of speech. Ability to configure sentence structures and add rules around them. I'd like to add [such](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) codes to the configuration.   

* Master List: I am always collecting words, phrases, sentences, anything and everything. So far I have failed to collate them. Referring to them is like learning emacs. I'd want to be able to maintain a file, a very large file for this purpose and break the contents down into sub-file with the ability to change text in one and also have it reflect in the master file. 

* Version: The typewriter excels at informing me where I began and where I am going. I can check the birth of a paragraph and its growth over sentences. I want the document to always tell me what this sentence was built on. I am not sure if I am being clear. 

* Files and Organisation: Emacs gave me nightmares over file management. I am still now sure how I'd like to structure my work. 

* Durability: The above and much more is meant to be worked on over many years. I want each keystroke to be in one place.

Not a huge deal but since I still don't have these characters fully in touch-typing memory (well * is ok, I stop a bit for #), realizing that makes it easier to find them quickly.

I also tend to use # or * to activate the search and then 'n' and 'N' to go back and forth. The fact that they're on the same finger makes it a tiny bit easier to stop using 'n' and 'N' and instead # and *. Kind of like putting myself in position for search with both middle fingers on the top row.

"Hello dear readers, yesterday i read about a (for me) new modal editor, which takes vim as a starting point and uses it to create a new ""more thoughtout"" experience.
For example x and d are merged into one key: d and the most important thing i read so far, you don't start your actions with a verb and end it with a noun
(e.g. dw to delete a word, dp to delete a paragraph), but you start with the positioning and execute the action on that noun (e.g. wd and pd).
The last notable change is the merge of the normal-/ and visualmode we all know from vim into one mode, which is always giving feedback about your actions.
This is all i read/heard about kakoune before i started my journey

Part 1: Installation.

As i am using an OSX machine, i prefer to start with the brew installation guide, provided on https://github.com/mawww/kakoune#2-getting-started.
While i was waiting for the installation to finish, i looked at some screenshots, which show kakoune in action and noted a few differences to vim already.
1)CLIPPY IS BACK!: The small helper, older people might remember from Windows XP is celebrating its comeback on kakoune. You will see it, whenever you need some help.
2)It looks like there is some kind of semantic autocompletion available out of the box, which would be awesome, as it is one of vims major flaws, because you have to
either rely on the heavyweight Plugin ""YouCompleteMe"" or pray to not shoot yourself in the leg while trying to configure deoplete and tab movements.

Part 2: First steps with editing:
     After Installing kakoune, you can start it with ""kak"". While this does not sound as neat as ""vim"" you are greeted with a blank screen.
     The first i will do is try writing a simple prime-number program in c, which prints all primenumbers between 1 and 1000, the point of this is to compare kakoune after
     writing the same code in vim.
     After writing the code in vim, the first thing i notice, is that neither '0' nor '$' work to move to the beginning/end of a line.
     To move to the end/beginning of a line you have to use gh or gl, for consistency you can also use gj/gk to go to the top/bottom of the file.
     I read about the multiselection and wanted to give it a shot. To use a simple example i wanted to copy a line a few times and use the multiselection on those.
     Sadly you cant just use yy to yank a line and press p a few times anymore.
     After looking shortly into the manual i read the following line : ""x: select line on which selection end lies (or next line when end lies on an end-of-line)"".
     If you free a key, you can use that key for something else. Curiously i pressed x and the whole line got selected and the cursor moved to the end of the line.
     Now i pressed 'ypppp' and could copy/paste that line a few times.
     As soon as i was able to yank/copy a few lines i gave the multiselection a shot.
     As far as i know the vim equivalent to the multiselection would be the ""Visual Block Mode"" (Ctrl-V), which allows you to select a few lines and work in parallel on them.
     Kakoune takes this multiselection a whole layer further.
     By pressing '%' the whole file is selected, when you press 's' you can enter a regular expression and everything in the file, that matches said expression will be selected.
     If you press now <CR>, you have a cursor on every occurance and from there you can do your editing commands.
     To test this feature i wanted to replace all 'int' with 'double'.
     I entered '%sint<CR>' and saw, that not only every int was selected, but also every printf call. That was not the intendet result, as i don't want to have a prlongf call
     every now and then :D
     The regex for a whitespace is \h and so i entered '%sint\h<CR>' and now i got my result.
     Granted, it may seem counterintuitive replacing every int with a long, especially if you can do it in vim with a simple search/replace.
     Still i believe that this feature is better than just plain search/replace, as you can see highlighted which items will be replaced and you can make changes on your
     expression on the fly without pressing 'u' and going up in the commandhistory to change something.
     The next thing i wanted to try out is about jumping in a line.
     In vim you can jump with w to the beginning of the next word and with f or t to the next occurence of a following character.
     As i mentioned before Kakoune takes a different approach on that. You don't exactly ""move"" to a special place, you select everything in this movement and the cursor
     is placed on the last, by this movement effected, character.
     As soon as i press 'w' my cursor is resting after the end of the word. Now i have three options. Either i can extend/shorten the selection by pressing 'W' or 'B'.
     Also i am able to press 'w' again to start a new selection, while unselecting the previous word.
     The third option would be an action i can perform on the selected area. By pressing 'WWWWWd' (i could also use 'w' on the first movement).
     As i wanted to complain about the missing 'W' key to select a whole WORD (In vim a WORD is a sequence of characters, seperated by a whitespace. A word is kinda more complex
     to explain, but e.g. to jump over 'foo.bar()' you have to press w four times, as it is seperated by a . and a ( ), i read about <alt> commands.
     Sadly none of the <alt> commands seem to work on my mac (yeah i know, get a real computer hurrdurr). Pressing '<alt>w' should jump to the next WORD, but it just seems to do
     nothing, maybe a bug, maybe i forgot to toggle something :D .
     To conclude the getting started part, i seem to like kakounes approach, as it seems more fluently and more thought out at some points (although i feel a strong repulsion
     every time i have to use 'gh' to move to the beginning of a line, this just feels so wrong and misplaced, as i have to use two hands for that :D )
     If the alt key starts working i can give more feedback but for now some things are just missing, like searching backwards for a character.

Part 3: Customization and Plugins
     Let's be honest: vim without any plugins is a very, uhm, puristic experience.
     We all love vim because of all the available customizations. With a few steps we can use git, navigate between files and use every colorscheme known to man.
     Heck we can show some answers on stackoverflow to a given input text in a new buffer.
     On this topic there isn't much i can say about kakoune. I couldn't find any Plugins.
     I guess that is a problem you might encounter if you are not in the game for 40 years and rather less is found, if you search for something about kakoune.
     If I could wish something, it would be a vim-editor, which supports python3 as a scripting language.
     Back to the topic: I have tried to do some things, which are important to me and my workflow. I would like to have line numbers on the left side of the screen.
     The line i am currently on is the absolute number, all others are relatively numbered.
     In order to show the absolute line number, you have to add 'hook global WinCreate .* %{addhl number_lines}' to your kakrc (which is located relatively to your kakoune binary
     file, maybe someday there will be support for a .kakrc in your home directory).
     Relative numbering is something i couldn't find.
     Git seems to be available by default, as you can execute e.g. ':git add' from kakoune, without leaving it.
     The last thing i would like to take a look at is the code-completion.
     As we all don't like to write much we would love to just press '<tab>' and get everything written automatically.
     The default completion from kakoune is able to complete keywords from the language you write in and recognizes already written code and you can complete that too.
     Semantic completion seems to not being available for kakoune yet, so there is not much left to say.
     I hope some cool person is writing on a semantic completion plugin while i am writing this text, as this is just an awesome feature :D

Part 4: Final Words
     I guess i didn't cover everything there is to say about Kacoune, please don't be sad if i didn't cover e.g. buffers (they work), marks (haven't seen them)
     Macros (q replays the @ macro, Q records a Macro to the @ register, ""<character>Q records a macro to a different register and ""<character>q plays that macro.
     This has pros and cons, essentially if you use only one macro, you save some strokes, if you use more macros, you need some more strokes. No more vim-golf)
     I would love to see kakoune become a thing, especially as it is really nice and behaves more friendly to new users (CLIPPY). Also i can learn some new things
     as i read the recommendations from clippy.
It is a really nice experience and i can recommend this to all of you. I had much fun and i hope i can help the one or the other with this text.
Please don't hate me for my inexperience at writing, it is late from where i come from and English is my second language :D

"Not strictly vim-related but I use this very often while I'm in vim, and it boosts my productivity quite a lot. 

&#x200B;

I often press `CTRL-Z` to put vim in a background job (without closing it) and type a command. Then when I want to get back to vim I type `fg`. Actually often the command that I want to run after putting vim in background is actually in history so I just press `CTRL-P`.

&#x200B;

Problem is if you type `fg` to get back to vim, when you press `CTRL-P` your last command will be `fg`, which is annoying and often not the command you wanted to run. So I have this snippet in my **\~/.zshrc** that allows me to put something in background and bring it to the foreground with a single keybinding (without polluting command history with fg) : 

    # Allow Ctrl-z to toggle between suspend and resume 
    function Resume {  
        fg
        zle push-input 
        BUFFER=""""
        zle accept-line
    } 
    zle -N Resume
    bindkey ""^Z"" Resume

- Mapping <Leader> to space made things significantly easier for me. There is a all time top post on this subreddit labeled ""12 vim tips"" or something and it really helped me. My leader is <Space>. Now I can do things like <Space>w to save file, <Space>q to quit, <Space>ev to edit vimrc, <Space>h/j/k/l to move between vim splits. It's like when you play WoW and you transition from clicking to hotkeys.

- Vundle. I won't get into any arguments between Vundle or Pathogen, but I will say that I personally had a much better time with Vundle. My vimrc is cleaner, my .vim is cleaner. Moving between my arch box and my Macbook Air is so easy with Vundle - all I have to do is git pull my vimrc and run :PluginInstall. No more git wrangling - just commit your vimrc and you're done. I've also heard of a new 'Vundle' clone by Junegunn so I will definitely check that out sometime.

- ciw. Delete word on cursor and enter insert mode. This is one of my favorite native vim hotkeys and I use it so much.

- o and O. Enter new line below/above current line and enter insert mode. Coding life got much better after learning about these hotkeys.

- NERDTree and mapping it to <F3>. I love it that NERDTree works right out of the box. I can't really describe it, it just works and it works well.

- Learning vim window splitting. Ok I was on the tmux train for a while but in the end it was a pain in the ass. With Tmux I had a whole host of new hotkeys that clashed with vim, the support for Vim colors is horrendous, and setting it up can be a pain. I seriously had hand pains juggling between Vim and Tmux hotkeys. Vim window splitting was a much better solution. I usually have NERDTree on the left side, and split vim on the right.

Get the nightly iTerm2 [here](http://iterm2.com/downloads.html) that supports 24 bit color.

Clone ZyX's vim fork

        hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/vim

cd into it and run

        hg bookmark 24-bit-xterm

Run configure, including ""--enable-termtruecolor""

I ran this:

        ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-rubyinterp --enable-termtruecolor

        let &t_8b=""\e[48;2;%ld;%ld;%ldm""

Vim should now support 24 bit color.

"For emacs it's very popular to run only one instance as ""server"" and send all
files one wants to edit to it. The main reason for this is, as far as
I understand, that emacs take a bit to start up, like one second or so.

It's possible to do this with vim as well, using the `--server` option. However,
I'm running my vim in tmux, one vim per session, one session per project. I've
configured my vim instance to be the server for the current tmux session, by
using the tmux session variable.

Yet, I find myself often to just override this setup and start a quick vim
instance for editing a config file or so. Since vim starts up instantly, it
would take me longer to switch to the tmux window where my session vim is
running, which is most often for developing.

For my Todo list, I use a ""GTD-ish"" list, with ""Next actions"", ""Project plans"", ""Agenda"" and ""Waiting for"" for various contexts. Vimoutliner makes it very easy to add checkboxes, which I use. I move completed items under a ""DONE"" heading, then I have a perl script to ""clean out"" the file (moves all completed items into an archive file, preserving headings).

Since I use multiple computers (with different OS's) often, I have my entire notes directory controlled with git on a central server, so I can push/pull whenever I need to (plus that takes care of backup). I used to use Dropbox for that, which was a little more straightforward, but I moved off because of security concerns.

Anyway, that's more or less my system, and I've spent a lot of time getting it set up just the way I like. Anyone else have similar setups to share?",39,59,vim as note-taking/organization software... anyone else do this? Share your method!,vim

I've don't post plugins here often (ever?), but I was irrationally excited about [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) as a simple way to write presentations in markdown that export as a single html page.
(Found via an unexpected source of Javascript praise: Bitsquid dev Niklas Frykholm's old [Javascript Hot Reloading](https://github.com/niklasfrykholm/blog/blob/394cf141bc77a6ab815944a87abcf730684f60f1/2016/javascript-hot-reloading.md) post.)

It's pretty slick: try going to [remarkjs.com](https://remarkjs.com/), press C (clone view) and P (presenter view), put the original view on your projector, and you're ready to present.

Since remark is a single html, you have to write your markdown inside of it. I use markdown to avoid even thinking about html, so I looked around for a vim plugin to let me write in markdown and generate the html. I only found a ruby-based plugin ([remark.vim](https://github.com/mauromorales/vim-remark/blob/master/plugin/remark.vim)) that uses a template engine and seemed over complicated.

"I am a developer with 10 yrs experience and the concept of vim & tmux is like unicorns (Impractical & Utopian) for me. Since all the vim people are here, I am here to ask for guidance.

Just a background about me, I was an asp.net developer having only used windows. Since about a year, I have moved to a mac and working on rails. I have attempted to use Linux, but I usually get stuck even before I start. I once attempted to setup Arch Linux. I just formatted the machine and moved on after a week of kicking around in the dark. Not sure what I exactly did.

In my current workplace, everyone uses mac+sublime text+iterm+chrome. All three open is the same screen is how everyone work and that's what I am also doing.

I was really surprised when I found that tmux can be hosted on a different machine. I understand that these things seem normal to all you people & you guys approach development from a different way. I am interested in understanding it.

Is any developer using vim & tmux for working on rails? Do you load the browser into the tmux view? Most videos I found on youtube just assumes that the viewer knows a lot and usually I am left with more questions than answers. Is there vim & tmux tutorials for clueless newbies? I would really love to see a video tutorial that shows how to built a basic rails app using vim & tmux.

"I am a grad student. I sought help for my mental illness last year.  I go to one of those 'top 10' universities in the US. Grad life is hard, I do not have a lot of support from my family, and I am socially awkward.  As far as coursework and work was concerned, I was struggling to organize my work and time. I used to be a huge fan of services like Trello, RescueTime, Evernote, all those technologies out there for managing and organizing. I used notepad or MS Word for documentation and writing reports. I wrote code in Visual Studio and Anaconda's Spyder (no offense to Anaconda). That's what my friends were doing, but I guess it was not enough for me, because I tend to get very nervous when there is a lot of work, and the smallest things can push me off the edge.  I need everything to be organized and neat.

I discovered Emacs in May 2018. I was in a terrible place then. I thought I was never going to recover. I was just trying out different text editors to optimize my workflow when I found Emacs. The first thing that completely amazed me was org-mode:  agenda, the tree structure, org-babel, everything! Then I started writing all my code in Emacs, for all my coursework and work in machine learning, game development, etc. I learned how to store links to particular lines in huge code files, so that I can access them quickly, and continue work where I had left off. I also journal, I have been journaling for 4 years, that is how I deal with my problems. I have tried many software packages for journaling, and none of them come close to what I can do in Emacs. Now I can also write lisp scripts for doing simple routine processes that would make my workflow much simpler, so that I don't have to worry about small details and concentrate on more important things.

I have recovered significantly from my depression. I still feel terrible, but I can handle things with more ease because Emacs reduces a lot of unnecessary cognitive load. I wonder what I would have been if I had decided not to explore Emacs. It's true what they say, any text editor can save your files, only Emacs can save your soul.

- [Watching Youtube in Emacs](http://i.imgur.com/KsLQxNC.gifv) (due to GIF recording, the quality degraded but in reality, it's the same as other browsers).

- [Combine with `helm-google-suggeste`](http://i.imgur.com/2rTQeiG.gifv))

Just to show how useful this feature is, consider this demo of using `helm-dash` with EWW, previous web browser in Emacs 24:

But, that does not mean Eww is useless. It's still useful for web browsing within a terminal.

You can copy text from the browser, but before that you have to switch to browser buffer first. That's quite inconvenient, hopefully it will be fixed in the future, when you click the mouse and Emacs focuses on browser buffer.

"_UPDATE: I've [revised this article](https://ambrevar.bitbucket.io/emacs-eshell) by taking the awesome community feedback into account. Thank you all!_

----

Since its inception, Eshell has suffered from an arguably low popularity.
See what the community says:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/492edz/is_anybody_using_eshell_as_the_default_shell_any/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/48opk1/eshell_and_why_cant_i_convert_to_you/

Hell, even the official manual gives a fair warning against its use:

- https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html#Introduction

I'm not arguing that those arguments are not valid. (To most extent, they are.)

I want to argue that the issue is not so much that Eshell is not a
proper _Unix shell_ (in the sense of POSIX sh and derivatives), but rather
perhaps we do not need a _Unix shell_ and all its historical limitations.

In other words: the non-Unix-ness of Eshell is more of a step forward than a
hindrance.  Let's review the situation.


# ""State of the art""

Take this typical scenario: I've got a long running process which finally
outputs pages of relevant information.  Only then I realize that it would have
been smart saving that somewhere.  Now I want to copy it to the clipboard.  How
do I do that?

_By clumsily mouse-selecting pages of terminal output, assuming my terminal can
handle it._

> Why can't I (fuzzy-)search the shell output?

> Why can't I browse the different prompts of my shell session?

> Why can't I copy/paste without a mouse?

Back in the days, VT-like terminals were our main mean of communicating with a
machine.  Decades went by, our desktop computers can now handle gigabytes of
buffering and display in 24-bit colors, and yet we still stick terminal
_emulators_, that is, programs that emulate the _restrictions_ of those ancient
machines.

- Cannot move the cursor around.

- Limited colors.

- Terminal capabilities are neither simple nor portable.  See termcap(5).

- Formatting (e.g. colors) needs ugly escape codes that are not even portable.

- More hacks than computer science history would have ever hoped for.

Say I run this command:

	$ cat file-list.txt
	/path/to/foo
	/other/path/to/bar

Now I want to see what's in _foo_.  How do I do that?

1. Either I mouse-select the file, hoping I'll not be off-by-one on one side.
Then I paste to the prompt.

2. Or I type the path myself, with a bit of luck completion will bring me there
soon enough.

All this is terribly backwards and it is high time we moved on.


# Terminals vs. shells

It's important to understand that shells are not (or should not be) semantically
bound to terminal emulator restrictions.  Shells are a textual interface to the
machine.  They just need _input, evaluation, execution, output_.
GTK/Qt/Tk/etc. are absolutely capable of handling such a task.  Not mentioning
Emacs...

So why do shells _de facto_ need a terminal?  One thing: curses-like interfaces.
Those libraries need terminal capabilities to render.  Do we still really need that?

- It's most limited in terms of UX.  Mouse selection simply won't do.

- It's not beautiful.

- It cannot render anything beside text.

- ""It works on low-end systems"": there is not much hardware out there that
cannot take Wayland or X.  Anyways, my case is about desktop computers.

- It's not even fast: in fact terminals can be pretty slow at rendering.
(Emulators also emulate the baud-rate.)

- Since it's character-based, it cannot render big fonts nor thin lines.

- ""Efficiency on remote systems"": that's almost a fair statement. But then...
  TRAMP! ;)


# Enter Eshell

Back to my initial example of the long-running process: want to copy that output
somewhere?  3 key-strokes with Eshell.  And better: could be even 1 if you want
to program it your way.  The _interface_ is extensible.  (Terminals usually
aren't, URxvt and its Perl scripts are not a proud example of _extensibility_.)

Eshell breaks up with the ""terminal-interface"" paradigm: the UI of the Eshell
_commandline-interface_ is Emacs itself.  The pager is the Emacs buffer.  The
input is Emacs keystrokes.  The extension language is Elisp.  Consequences:

- No need for pagers like less.  You won't ever re-run a long-output command by
  appending `| less` to it.

- Little need for output filtering (the `sed`, `grep`, `awk` black-magic):
output the result to an Emacs buffer, use some Lisp functions, use Evil ex
commands, iedit, helm-moccur or multiple-cursors...

- Eshell supports TRAMP!  Which means you don't have to put aside your powerful
environment when switching to root or connecting to a remote host: all the power
of _your_ Emacs can be used anywhere, the shell included.

- Find file/URL at point.  Or list them all with Ivy/Helm and fuzzy-search them!

- No need for [fzf](http://github.com/junegunn/fzf).  ""Hey! `fzf` is awesome!""  I know, but even `fzf` cannot compete
with Emacs.

- At last, done with the clumsy bash and sh-inspired shell languages!  No more
nasty word-splitting, no more unexpected expansion.  You don't even need `calc`
or `bc` when you have Elisp or Emacs calc at hand.

- No need for half-implemented vi-bindings when you can have Evil to edit your
command-line.  (Some shells like [fish](http://fishshell.com) can call an editor to edit the
commandline.  Well, with Eshell it's one step less.)

- You can even edit the output directly!

- You can redirect output to several buffers(!), they don't even need to be
existing files.

- Eshell has loads of [fancy
features](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell)
for globbing, filtering, and editing.

- Programmable completion with `pcomplete`, which is arguably easier and yet
more powerful than its bash/zsh/fish counterparts.


# There is more to come

It's undeniable however that, as of Emacs 25.2, Eshell has numerous rough edges.
Quite a few bug reports have been sent on debbugs and it's getting better.

Eshell's parser has some bugs here and there.  It will most notably fail at
parsing some `sed` expressions.  Which does not matter so much because you don't
need `sed` when you have Emacs Lisp with all regexps functions you can think of,
coupled to fuzzy-matching.

(EDIT: This issue got fixed in Emacs 26: https://debbugs.gnu.org/db/29/29157.)

Eshell does not support input redirection, but again, it is far less relevant
when you have Emacs directly at hand.

Native completion is limited considering very little work was made.  The
community can help changing that.  In the meantime, I've implemented [a fallback to bash completion
as well as fish
completion](https://github.com/Ambrevar/emacs-fish-completion)
so that I can keep completing just as much as I could with bash or fish.

Need that curses-based program?  Get a (much more) powerful Emacs alternative:

- git (CLI), gitk, tig, etc. -> magit

- htop -> symon, proced, helm-top...

- abook -> org-contacts

- mutt -> mu4e, gnus

- ncdu -> dired-du

- cmus/moc -> EMMS

- newsbeuter -> Elfeed, gnus

- weechat, irssi -> ERC, etc.

- rtorrent, transmission-cli -> transmission.el

As opposed to their curses counterparts, Emacs alternatives share all those
features:

- Configure/extend in Lisp.

- (Fuzzy-)search the buffer.  Copy anything to the clipboard.

- No need to change the color theme, it's already using your Emacs theme.  No
need for dircolors, lesspipe, Xresources...

- Emacs bindings (Evil?).  All configurable.  No more painful context-switch
between Emacs-based and vi-based bindings.


# An open door to Emacs-Everywhere

Switching to Eshell marked a milestone for me: from then on I dropped all my
crufty curses-based programs and switched to much more powerful Emacs
alternatives.  To the point that I now use [Emacs as my window
manager](https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm).  Having a consistent environment well
glued together really empowers you.

Ironically, the environment is so powerful that I ended up not using any shell
so much anymore, only for a few commands here and there.  For which I use
Eshell, obviously.



Eshell might not be perfect (yet), a little beta perhaps, but this can only be
helped by a growing community: the more people join, the more feedback
developers get, the better it will become.  Hopefully this pamphlet will
help raise your curiosity, if not more esteem for this brilliant project.



## EDIT: Some more Eshell niceties with Helm

- `helm-find-files` has `M-e` to switch to Eshell in the currently browsed folder.  Bye bye, `cd`, hello fuzzy-browsing!

- The previous technique makes it very convenient to go up the hierarchy to some parent folder (`C-l` by default).  Seriously, bye bye, annoying little `cd ..`.

- Still with `helm-find-files`, `M-p` will trigger the ""cd history"", so you can fuzzy-find the history of your shell paths.
Make it persistent with `(add-to-list 'desktop-globals-to-save 'helm-ff-history))`.

- Use Helm as a menu for completion.  Awesome for completing big file names or packages!

- `helm-find-files` has `C-c i` (and `C-u C-c i`, etc.) to insert the selected relative/absolute file names at point, that is, in the commandline.  This sometimes proves more convenient than file completion.

"_UPDATE: I've [revised this article](https://ambrevar.bitbucket.io/emacs-everywhere) by taking the awesome community feedback into account.  Thank you all!_

----

For many years I refrained from using Emacs everywhere because I clung to the
following Unix philosophical principle: ""Make each program do one thing well.""
It did not make sense to me then to use a text editor as an e-mail client or a
music library manager.  I used to favour well-established ncurses programs like
Mutt and cmus respectively.

When I started using Eshell as my main shell, the benefits of the Emacs
_interface_ became increasingly obvious.  Maybe my initial reasoning was not
well founded after all.  Since then I successfully moved on to using this
user-interface-on-steroids everywhere.  Looking back, it feels like I had been
missing out and wasted my time for that many years.

This realization is what leads me to write a pamphlet on the matter as it seems
that many Emacs users follow the same reasoning and might miss out on the full
extent of Emacs power.
When I recently posted an argumentation over using [Eshell as a main
shell](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/duplicates/6y3q4k/yes_eshell_is_my_main_shell/),
I faced some skepticism when I deemed curses-like interfaces as backwards as
opposed to Emacs.  More generally, it seems that the popular stance is well
summed up in the following famous joke:

> Emacs is a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor.

While obviously sarcastic, it might be worth point out that no, Emacs' intent is
not to be an operating system.  That being said, it is true that Emacs is not
_only_ an editor.  From a broader perspective, it would be best described as
a _programmable, text-oriented user-interface_ (containing, among others, an
editor).

As such it is erroneous to discard Emacs special modes for the sole reason that
an editor should not do anything but editing text.  If you think of Emacs as a
user interface, then it covers the same ground as Qt, GTK, Tk or _curses_ and
the Unix-philosophical argument falls flat.

Emacs might not suit everybody's needs everywhere, although I believe that more
often than not it will.  Hopefully the insights of this pamphlet will add enough
fuel to the fire to help nuance the various views held by the community.



## Emacs vs. the others

The power features Emacs offers and that are lacking in other ""common""
interfaces (GTK, Qt, Tk, EFL, cocoa, curses, etc.) include:

- Everything is text, everything is searchable and copy-able.  Even better, you
can fuzzy-search anything.  Enter Helm, Ivy and others.

- It can be fully keyboard-controlled (not very common with GTK and friends),
while mouse controls are supported too (which sucks in ncurses).

- It works both in graphical and textual environments, mostly out-of-the-box.
Nevertheless you should prefer the less limited graphical Emacs: all keyboard
modifiers are supported, various font sizes can be displayed, and... pictures!

- Configuration is done in Emacs Lisp.  Which is the best language ever, as [we
all know](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).  At least when it comes to
[extensibility](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html).  And even
if you don't agree with that, it sucks less than most of its competitors.

- Configuration, as a consequence of being Lisp, can be tracked by version
control systems.



## What Emacs really does

Now let's move on to the core of the question: Is it wise to have _everything_
run from within Emacs?

A common misconception when thinking of ""Emacs as an OS"" is to assume that Emacs
special modes are re-inventing the wheel.  They are not (for most of them),
Emacs and its modes focus on the _user interface_ side of things.  The backends
are almost always separate programs.  This is precisely where the Unix
philosophy still stand strong.  Using Emacs as an interface for everything is
merely equivalent to using GTK-only applications.  (Only much better,
obviously.)

As opposed to other user interfaces Emacs is a _programmable_ environment: any
structure, interface element and even code can be passed around and combined
between the different interfaces to various programs.  Consider those canonical
features:

- Buffers

- The kill-ring

- The ""undo"" command (or better: undo-tree)

- Bookmarks

- Windows

- Abbreviations if that's your thing

- Snippets if that's your thing

- Completion

- Spell checking

All of them can be applied to (when it makes sense):

- Magit

- Gnus, mu4e, whatever e-mail client you prefer

- Dired, Helm-find-files

- Elfeed, Gnus again

- EMMS

- Org-mode (notes, agenda, contacts, publishing...)

And many more.

Emacs does not lure developers into reinventing the wheel, quite the opposite:
it shines at reusing and combining features in the most unexpected ways.



## The perks of Emacs as a user interface

There is more to it:

- Since Emacs can display pictures: EMMS can display album covers, e-mails can
display inline attachments.

- Configuration consistency: Bindings, color themes and other interface elements
are consistently shared across the various special modes.  No need to waste time
_syncing the different configuration files of your different programs_ (in
different configuration languages).

- Configure, extend, fix: With Emacs, everything is configurable, even what was
not foreseen by its developers.  All the Lisp source code is available at hand.
Want to add a feature?  It's usually as simple as adding a few Elisp lines to
the configuration.  Something is broken?  After reporting it upstream, you don't
have to wait for the next release, you can hot-patch the bug from your
configuration.

- Universality.  Emacs is somewhat easy to compile.  It runs on virtually all
desktop platforms you could think of.  As such, running everything from Emacs
effectively abstracts away the OS user interface, which makes it possible to use
your personal configuration on any system.  This is especially useful when you
are forced to a famous crappy OS.

- OS-independent package manager: This provides the user with cutting-edge
packages even on (rusty) conservative distributions or when the user has no
privileges.

- Flatter learning-curve of new programs: Emacs documentation system is (more or
less) consistently used among all Emacs modes, which makes the learning process
of a new mode somewhat easier.  No need to figure out where the static
documentation is (HTML page? man page?), Emacs lets you (fuzzy-)search the
configuration variables and the bindings.

- Lightweight, efficient: When I replaced all my super-lightweight _curses_
programs with their Emacs counterparts, I did not notice a significant change in
disk usage.  With the difference that ELPA packages have both the source code
and the byte-compiled files installed.  For programmers and tinkerers, having
source code at hand is a boon.  In terms of performance, graphical Emacs is not
limited by the restrictions born by terminal emulators and inflicted upon
_curses_ programs.



## Side effects and other niceties

- If you use Eshell, you don't need that lengthy, clunky bash/zsh/fish
configuration anymore.

- Other cumbersome configurations can go: `dircolors`, `lesspipe`,
`Xresources`... Even `fzf` can be disposed of.

- No need to duplicate your dotfiles for the root user or on remote machines:
use TRAMP!



## EXWM to rule them all

EXWM was for me the last milestone in the course of The Big Shift to a fully
Emacs-based environment.

I've been an avid user of AwesomeWM for years, but with time I grew tired of
""losing windows"" among the excess of tags or screens.  I wish I could have just
fuzzy-searched them with `fzf` or something similar.  I never managed to
implement the idea.  Until I discovered EXWM.

EXWM has all the benefits of being Emacs-based.  Which includes the ability to
fuzzy-select windows with Helm!  ""Lost windows"" belong to the past.  When
opening several windows at once, you can configure how to display them.  (This
is a [recent addition to
Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/commit/a66849bfc008bc0082b0a97caa3ac75652f0a8ad).)
A nice use-case is to first narrow down some windows using Helm patterns,
display them all in an Exposé fashion, and finally select your desired windows
visually.

Since the window management is extensible, you can write your own
`helm-window-show-buffers-function` to fine-tune your needs: always display the
compile buffer at the same spot, behave differently depending on the number of
buffers or depending on the content or the modes, etc.  It is so convenient to
bring up windows all at once with EXWM+Helm that I've quit using workspaces
(a.k.a. tags) altogether in favour of a more global approach.

Maybe one the most noticeable benefit on a daily basis is that it lifts up some
weight off the _cognitive burden_ of having to manage windows both from Emacs
and from an external window manager.  With EXWM, there is no more need to
remember two sets of bindings and windowing rules, the windowing being
effectively fully centralized.  For instance I used to reserve the `super` key
for all windowing bindings with AwesomeWM; now I reserve it to all Emacs
windowing operations, and there is no need for other bindings.

Adepts of the suckless philosophy would argue that Emacs should leave all
windowing, including its own, to an external specialized program, the window
manager.  But from the perspective that Emacs is a user interface, it is not
that much of a heresy to consider that Emacs is precisely _that window manager_.

Having Emacs as a window manager has some additional benefits, namely that it is
fully aware of the content of the Emacs buffer, which allows for specializing
windowing actions depending of the different buffers.  This is much harder to do
with any other window manager.



## From rusty programs to Emacs

Here follows the list of applications I've personally transited from.

- Abook: Org-contacts (and maybe BBDBv3 when it's done)

- Ranger, vifm, fzf: dired, helm-find-files

- fzf: Helm, Ivy

- Xterm, URxvt: `M-x shell`, `M-x term`

- Bash, Zsh, Fish: Eshell

- Mutt: Gnus, mu4e, many more.

- cmus, moc: EMMS

- Zathura, apvlv: PDF-tools

- AwesomeWM, i3, etc.: EXWM

- rtorrent, transmission: transmission.el

- xclip, xsel: Emacs (graphical)

- ncdu: dired-du

- dhex, etc.: nhexl-mode

- bc, calc: `M-x calc`, Elisp

- newsbeuter: Elfeed, Gnus

- trash-cli: `(setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t)`

- ncftp, curlftpfs: TRAMP

- taskwarrior, etc.: Org-mode

- Spreadsheet software: Org-mode (!)

- gitk, etc.: Magit

- w3m, lynx, elinks: Eww


Hell, Emacs even replaces my web browser for some of the websites I use most:

- Emacs bugs: debbugs

- MediaWiki-based pages: mediawiki-mode

- StackExchange pages: sx

And reddit is still missing... :)


### EDIT

Another perk of using Emacs as everything is the ""global state"" of all Emacs special modes.  Say you want to switch transmission to turtle mode, there is no need to switch to transmission first, you can invoke the command or its associated binding directly, regardless of the buffers curretly under focus.  Same goes for music with EMMS, or anything else running in the background.",110,185,Emacs Everywhere,emacs

If it succeeds, then I can work on Magit full-time for a whole year. I am still overflowing with ideas, and depend on your support to realize them.

I would love to work on Magit for at least another year and think that its users would miss out on a lot of significant improvements if I were unable to do so. Magit and I are at a crossroad — either I can intensive my efforts or I have to give up bringing the long time goals to completion that I have been working toward for the past few years.

Magit is still far from fulfilling its potential and now I need your help to get it there. If you haven't done so yet, then please [visit the campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681258897/its-magit-the-magical-git-client?ref=cbb3sz) to learn more about the planned improvements and please consider to make a contribution.

On a complete whim, I decide to scan through the helm completions for `org` and `table`: `M-x org table`. (This is one of the reasons I use helm: it's easy to discover new things.) At the very bottom, I see an Emacs command that's new to me: `org-table-create-or-convert-from-region`. It's bound to `C-c |`, so it must be somewhat useful, right? I select the table and execute the command, and *it works perfectly.* Everything is just lined up together exactly as I wanted it, in the columns I wanted them in, no hassle, aligned, everything.

I realize no one else probably cares about this, but I thought it was super cool and it completely blew my mind. That I would just find the perfect command for a pretty obscure, rare task just completely floors me.

"TL;DR: Read Key Bindings Convention, stop worrying about complexity of
Emacs bindings, and (hopefully) consider the possibility that it might
actually be easy to remember, efficient, and requires less typing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a myth that Emacs has lengthy and incomprehensible
keybindings. There're countless jokes and comics on this. Good laughs
indeed, but at the end of day, it's *not* incomprehensible. It has
well-defined conventions listed at:

[Emacs Key Bindings
Convention](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html)

In summary, the general rules are: 
1. `C-x` reserved for Emacs native essential keybindings: buffer,
   window, frame, file, directory, etc...
2. `C-c` reserved for user and major mode:
   - `C-c letter` reserved for user. `<F5>-<F9>` reserved for user.
   - `C-c C-letter` reserved for major mode.
3. Don't rebind `C-g`, `C-h` and `ESC`.

[Flow Chart](https://yiufung.net/ox-hugo/emacs-mindmap.png)

That's mostly it. 

While I started learning Emacs, I had this similar misconception, so without
a second thought, I chose to go with vim-bindings, which I used for 6
years, with Spacemacs. It's surely a great project, opening up all the
goodies of Emacs to a vimmer. The mnemonics system is quite effective too, at 
least at the very beginning. However, over time I found that:

1. Mnemonics requires more key presses: `SPC f f` (3) vs `C-x C-f` (2
   keys, or 2.5?), `SPC h d f` (4) vs `C-h f` (2). Most search-tools like ag, rgrep requires 4 key
   presses. This is 50%-100% difference! We didn't even count in the extra `ESC` to enter normal state. Mistype rate is higher as a
   result, and gets frustrating quickly.
2. Commands from various packages can be placed under same key prefix
   `SPC letter`, making it difficult to form an overall picture of
   what things each package does/can do, which is essential for
   customization in long term.
3. The consideration of how commands should be organized evolves over
   time, so user needs to adapt accordingly. (I personally recommend
   all Spacemacs friends to watch [Spacemacs ABC
   Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v`ZFV5EqpZ6_s), it's
   gorgeous, but recorded 3 years ago, many keybindings have changed
   since).

These problems gave me a headache, urging me to write my own config. I
could have tried evil-mode, but having seen too many evil-mode-related compatibility
issues in Spacemacs project, I did not think my poor Elisp skills can
support me through the extra mess added on top of writing a config
from scratch. So the dilemma in front of me is: continue with
Spacemacs mnemonics, or go with Emacs native bindings? I feel lucky
now that I chose to give Emacs binding a try.

At first it seemed difficult, but after I read the convention, I
learned how to focus on the important parts when reading Emacs
bindings. For example, in `org-mode`, the command `org-insert-link` is
bind to `C-c C-l`. At first sight it seems complex: I need to remember
to press `Control` (""not `Alt`""), and keep it pressed, and pressed `l`
again... but the idea is actually short:
1. I'm trying to call a major-mode specific command (`org-*`), so I
   should press `C-c` first.
2. Major-mode commands should use `C-letter`.
3. (Same-old) mnemonics: `l`ink!

Then the only thing I need to remember is actually just: `l`. A much
more succinct mindmap, isn't it? Longer bindings are no more
daunting. For example, in ESS (mode for statistical languages such as
R, Stata), `ess-load-library` is bound to `C-c C-e C-l`. Seems long,
but all it says is just 2 keys with mnemonic: `l(oad)` under `e(xtra)`
in major-mode!

Of course there're exceptions: in the above example, the companion
command for `org-insert-link` is `org-store-link`, which is
[suggested to bind to `C-c
l`](https://orgmode.org/manual/Activation.html#Activation), occupying
one of my customized binding space. But now at least 1) I know why
it's not bound by default, and why it suggests this binding; 2) I know
I have the freedom to bind to other keys. 

Hope these are useful for new Emacs users, or
Vimmers/Spacemacsers who had never tried Emacs native key bindings. I
like to perceive the process of learning keybindings as acquainting
oneself with the layout of a toolbox: Calling a command is like
knowing where your tool lies in the box, and a clear layout improves
productivity vastly. Native Emacs bindings is the layout designed by
the toolbox creator(s). It's actually comprehensible and
reasonable. It's mnemonic at many aspects. Its `C-c` bindings for major-mode,
isn't it just the same idea of Spacemacs major-mode leader key `,`? It's discoverable too, as all
commands come with the same prefix now, one can dig really deep
into a single package, know what's being offered, and make the most of
it. Give it a go!

One last thank you note for this subreddit. I started with Spacemacs 9
months ago, wrote my personalized init file 5 months ago, and nowadays
I'm using Emacs every day. It has completely changed my ideas about
programming/writing. Actually, I wouldn't hesitate to say that Emacs
is the best thing I learnt in 2018, and a lot of it I learn from
here. Thanks!

"Dear fellow Emacs users,

I'm very happy to introduce PeachMelpa.org to everyone, living at [http://peach-melpa.org/](http://peach-melpa.org/).

Peach Melpa is a showcase for all themes hosted on MELPA. I did it relatively quickly using Rails and some dreadful Lisp code (I'd never done Lisp before) but it eventually managed to do the very simple task of grabbing every theme on MELPA (with the very simple: ""does the name end with -theme?"" heuristic), screenshooting itself then uploading it to S3.

I will upload the code tomorrow on GitHub as it's a bit late here in London and I can't afford the effort to log back into my non-work account, but I'll definitely request some help tomorrow and get feedback.

It's definitely not fully ready yet, and I'll keep you posted on the progress in the roadmap, namely:

- an actual styling (not convinced about what I did);

"I like using Emacs. However, at my latest job I was stuck with having to code in Java. I attempted to use eclim to edit things, but it was incredibly slow for most operations, and support was recently removed for Windows. After having to rebuild the Eclipse workspace for the 10th time, I ended up moving to IntelliJ IDEA for productive work. But then, I wondered if there was a similar server thing for IDEA. So I looked around, and found the [intellivim](https://github.com/dhleong/intellivim) project, which was that exactly, except it only supported Vim through a custom protocol. So, itching to be able to work with my preferred editor, I decided to use the intellivim code as a base (hope the author doesn't mind) and refactor it to conform to the [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) specification. A bit later, here are the work-in-progress results.

"_Update: This initiative was merged with evil-integration into a new repository, [evil-collection](https://github.com/jojojames/evil-collection).  Stay tuned there :)_

--------

The [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil) mode is widely considered the best Vim
emulation layer out there to the extent that ""Evil is Emacs true editor"" has
become a recurrent joke.

And yet, despite its tremendous success, many Vim users and other modal-editing
enthusiasts refrain from switching to it for the sake of one major hindrance:
that Evil bindings are not ubiquitous within Emacs and that too many special
modes will require a ""binding context switch"" that can be disconcerting, if not
a frustrating cognitive burden.

The solution is obvious: write bindings for all the modes that require it.
That is, all the Emacs vanilla modes, but also all the third-party, community
supported packages.

Facing the Herculean proportions of this task, no wonder that we haven't seen it
happening in years.  And yet this is too bad.

For too many of us, Evil users, the ""binding context switch"" is a daily pain in
the hands.  If you've felt among the brave ones, maybe you've rolled up your
sleeves and derived some approximate, mildly inconsistent bindings of your own.
For countless hours of frustration.

Writings bindings, at least consistent ones, _is hard_.

Last but not least, this might be the last milestone before many Vim
wannabe-converts actually make the final move to join the ranks of the Emacs
community :)

Enough pain.

I believe it's high time we started a community movement and joined forces to
face the current situation.  Let's review the task at hand:

- Define guidelines to enforce bindings as consistent as possible across a wide
variety of modes.

- Write bindings for the ""rest of vanilla Emacs"" that is not covered yet.  Since
Emacs, despite its huge size, features a limited number (understand ""finite"") of
special modes and that most of those are rather simple (think `package-menu`),
this is very feasible.  This would also be a good starting point as a reference
for the guidelines.

- Create Evil binding sets for all the popular third-party packages out there.
(I know that's crazy.)

I've decided to start tackling the issue of vanilla Emacs: https://github.com/Ambrevar/evil-special-modes.
Modes that are mostly covered so far:

- Calendar

- Customize

- Debugger

- Diff-mode

- Eshell

- Help

- Image-mode

- Info

- Man

- Outline

- Package

- Profiler

- Term

- Woman

- And the all-star special: the minibuffer! :)

Regarding the third-party packages, a few Evil modes are already out there, most
famously Evil-Magit, Evil-Ediff and Evil-Org / Org-Evil.  I've already drafted
some key-bindings for, among others, Debbugs, Elfeed, EMMS, Helm, Transmission.
Hopefully with the growing effort the word will spread and further encourage the
development of more and more binding sets.

I would like to call upon the help of the community to refine the Evil
guidelines.  I've started laying down a draft together with the special mode
bindings at https://github.com/Ambrevar/evil-special-modes.  You are all invited
to test the package, review the rationale and post some feedback, it would be
very much appreciated!

"I would like to ask the Emacs' Subreddit to help me with an important problem.

But first a boring history less---feel free to skip this.  GNU Emacs has been my editor of choice all the way since 1993, when I began programming at the age of eight (I still have an O'Reily guide for GNU Emacs 19, heh).  Even though I grew up using Windows, I learned all of my fundamentals about computer programming using GNU tools ported to DOS by the great DJGPP project.  Bash was my first shell, GCC my first compiler, GNU AWK my first *""I'll surely never need this damned thing"" program, and so on.

In late 2010 I got my first professional programming job in the field of web development, primarily working on the behind-the-scenes code that users never see unless something breaks.  For a cornucopia of reasons those projects involved use the PHP language.  At the time a new version of PHP was on the horizon with some important changes.  No one had updated the exsting PHP Mode project since 2004.  So I took it upon myself to patch in some changes to facilitate more modern PHP practices and made it available on [the GitHub project page](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode).  To my absolute surprise, my changes became the ""definitive"" version with regard to package managers and repositories like MELPA; even the original mode author Turadg Aleahmad emailed me with his person approval and handed me the password and credentials to the original SourceForge site.

For exactly six years *to the day* I have maintained PHP Mode,  although not alone.  The frequently contributor and great programmer Syohei ""syohex"" Yoshida has been a fantastic co-maintainer the past three years, helping me whenever I have been unable to give PHP Mode the full attention it needs; in fact, I use more packages by Yoshida and /u/abo-abo more than I do those of any other people.

But it is time for someone to replace me.  I believe the co-maintainer system works well, and more importantly, I do not want to suddenly ditch the project and leave Yoshida abruptly stuck with PHP Mode.  Nor do I want work on PHP Mode to grind to a halt.  However, I am suffering from serious kidney failure.  I just turned thirty-three years old in May, but even with dialysis, without a transplant and multiple surgeries I will only live two or three more years.  I may still sometimes work on PHP Mode, but I honestly doubt it.  So I am please asking anyone with any interest to consider taking my position on the project, and if you have a GitHub account I will be glad to give you full permissions for the repository instead of forcing package repositories to update their links, among other things.

Thank you for your time reading this.

**Edit 2:** Thank you so much for all of the care and compassion and well wishes.  I know almost none of you in real life, so the outpouring of support demonstrates how truly wonderful the Emacs community is.  Despite the fact I will very likely die around age thiry-five (2020-ish), I feel like my life as a computer programmer has been more than worth it, even if it is cut short.  And a big reason for that feeling is all thanks to all of you.  This thread has motivated me to continue programming until I just physically cannot lift a finger.  And I apologize if this all sounds over-dramatic to you or if it sounds like I am seeking sympathy, because that is far, far from the truth.  I only want to make it clear that working *for* the Emacs community and *with* the Emacs community is the motivation that keeps me writing code despite all the odds.  So again, I cannot thank you all enough.  I will do my best to leave GNU Emacs in a better state than when I started using it, improving it by any means possible.

"I saw /u/djolereject's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/a4bjtc/capture_loop/) about fitness tracking in Org, and I decided it was time to publish an old project of mine. Here is an Org fitness/food/weight tracker I put together a few years ago.

https://gist.github.com/alphapapa/982467abc1bf29f57c5cd2c408a77bd5

**Screenshots**: [1](https://i.imgur.com/8RfN6av.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/kIdqGmR.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/VgHsLzB.png), [food summary for day in echo area and hydra](https://i.imgur.com/S9CfNOn.png), [animation showing data entry with Helm](https://i.imgur.com/jHRPugb.gif), [animation showing navigation with Helm and a report (pressing C-j to preview sections, RET to go to them)](https://i.imgur.com/UVkRUEA.gif)

I haven't used it for a while, but it was very useful, and it really worked to help me improve fitness and control weight, and even spend less money on food.  I modified some of the data to cut it down to size and make it seem more current.  (I should start using it again!)

It's all contained in a single file, and the only dependencies are some Python packages like `pandas` and `matplotlib` that you can install with `pip` outside of Emacs.

One of the most interesting things is that the plots showed the correlations between calorie intake and weight, training and weight, and training progress.

All data is stored in Org tables.  Helm is used to make capturing repetitive data very quick easy by selecting from existing items, and capturing new food or training items is easy as well by prompting for each field.  `C-c C-f` captures food data, and `C-c C-w` captures workout data.  Weight data is captured with Org capture using a [template](https://gist.github.com/alphapapa/982467abc1bf29f57c5cd2c408a77bd5#file-weight-capture-template-el).

Plotting is done with Python that's contained in Org source blocks, which are automatically tangled and executed with `C-c C-p`, or when new data is captured.

It's not super fast to generate the new plots, especially when the tables get big, because Org has to convert to Python data structures.  But it's fast enough for me, and it's very useful, powerful, and customizable.

Some data is calculated automatically, like calorie targets, based on age, height, weight, activity level, etc.  See the `Config` section of the file.

There are also reports generated in the Org file showing optimal days, food items sorted by calorie, protein, etc.

Navigation through the file is very fast using `C-l`, which calls `helm-org-in-buffer-headings`.  Make sure to enable `helm-org-format-outline-path` for best results.

I can't provide much support for using this, but it may be useful to someone, and it may be a starting point for designing one's own system.  Ideally some of the code would be factored out into code files in a repo, but it's also a cool demonstration of a self-contained interactive Emacs ""app"" in a single Org file.

By the way, I must mention the amazing [emacs-gif-screencast](https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast) package.

The readme is quite thourough, you'll find screenshots, both a short and a detailed feature list, all config options, the entire keymap, and near drag-and-drop installation instructions (yes, it's on MELPA).

I am also working on a spacemacs layer that will replace the default neotree, though it's not done yet. It's being discussed [here](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/9285). You can find the layer [here](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/spacemacs/tree/treemacs-layer/layers/%2Btools/treemacs). If you want to test it adding my fork as a remote and cherry-picking the treemacs commit should do the trick.

A question that's likely going to be asked is support for multiple frames / perspectives: As of right now there's only one buffer that's shared everywhere. That'll change eventually, I'm currently engaged in retooling treemacs to make its buffers local to a frame, but it's a complex refactoring with many compatibility issues, so I cannot say when it'll be done. I've also plans to add workspaces as you know them from eclipse.

Then there's also the matter of icons: treemacs uses proper png images, so quantity is always an issue. If you have an icon I can use do let me know. I am using 22x22 px png images that must look reasonably nice with both dark and bright themes.

The incomplete coverage of Evil was the main critique that discouraged many Vim fans from using Emacs.

Although more than 60 modes and counting are supported, our work is not over
yet: some points in the rationale still need to be worked out, some modes are
missing.  Development is very active and lots of improvements are to be expected
in the near future.  Should you run into any issue or miss a mode in particular,

"Hi everyone,

I have recently discovered MobileOrg but noticed it hasn't been supported for years now. So I have forked the repo https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android and started working on improving it. [Here is what it looks like for the time being.](http://i.imgur.com/4H2nm2p.png)  

&nbsp;


Here is the summary of the mechanics so far. The primary reason of this post is that I'd like some feedback about them. Most of them are not implemented yet but it's better having feedback before than after spending time coding it:

&nbsp;

* You can cycle-through visibility by clicking on one item: it will successively expand all descendants, expand only first-order children and fold all descendant. 
* If you click DONE, TODO or in the blank part where they should be, you'll have a popup box to change the state.  
* To insert an item from this window, I was thinking about implementing with long clicks: if you stay pressed on an item, 4 options are offered to the users. 2 options: Insert node before/after current node and at the same level + insert before at the previous node level + insert after at the next node level  
* You should also be able to move a node with a drag&drop action.  
* If you want to edit an item you need to swipe it to the left and it open a new window. I have to say, I am not a big fan of this mechanic but I can't see a better one. The newly opened window will have buttons for settings tags, TODO states, scheduled date and deadlines. There will be also textboxes to edit the title of the item and his content. And probably a button to insert sub-node. This window is still under construction but [here is my starting point](http://i.imgur.com/DjZotLv.png).

&nbsp;

That's all for the moment but I am eager to hear all the propositions that you might have for making MobileOrg great again.

"I just noticed that ESS recently merged a PR that added support for flymake. I thought that was kinda weird, since as far as I knew, flymake wasn't used very much since it had some pretty major limitations.

Well, to my delight, that seems to be no longer the case in Emacs 26! It got a major rewrite, here's the NEWS entry:

    Flymake has been completely redesigned
    
    Flymake now annotates arbitrary buffer regions, not just lines.  It
    supports arbitrary diagnostic types, not just errors and warnings (see
    variable 'flymake-diagnostic-types-alist').
    
    It also supports multiple simultaneous backends, meaning that you can
    check your buffer from different perspectives (see variable
    'flymake-diagnostic-functions').  Backends for Emacs Lisp mode are
    provided.
    
    The old Flymake behavior is preserved in the so-called ""legacy
    backend"", which has been updated to benefit from the new UI features.

I've been test driving it today in R-mode and it works just as well as flycheck does. Hopefully as more major modes add support, Emacs will have out-of-the box syntax checking for most languages!

Thanks very much Emacs devs! We appreciate all your hard work. Thanks especially João Távora who seems to be the person who did most of the flymake rewrite.

EDIT: This isn't meant to disparage flycheck at all, by the way. It's a great package, one that I've thoroughly enjoyed using for years. I'm just excited that we'll get this functionality out-of-the-box.",21,124,"Starting in Emacs 26, you might not need flycheck!",emacs

"A while ago I spent some time carefully figuring out how Emacs undo
works.  I decided to post this here; perhaps you might find it
interesting.

First, you should have a basic idea of how Emacs
[undo](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html)
works.  When you edit a file, changes are placed on a undo list.  When
you undo, the state of the buffer is reverted according to the undo
list; however the undo itself is placed on the undo list, so you redo
by undoing again.  The advantage of this approach is that you will
never lose any state your buffer was in, and all states are available
via a linear undo (unlike undo-tree which requires navigating a
non-linear tree).

Unforunately, after many undos and undos of undos and undos of undos of
undos, it's quite easy to get your undo history into an interesting
mess, but once you understand exactly how it works, it's not so
bad (keep reading).

First, I will describe the rules governing undo.  Next I will walk
through an example of a complex undo change.  Finally, I will present
the state of the undo list for completeness.

If you read the manual, linked above, you will know that there are two
undo commands, `undo` and `undo-only`.  `undo-only` will only undo,
skipping undoing undos (redoing).

The rules:

- All changes, including undos, get added to the front of the undo
  chain.
- `undo` moves back one state along the undo chain.
- `undo-only` moves back one state along the temporal axis.
- `undo-only` always move backward along the temporal axis.
- `undo` moves in the opposite direction along the temporal axis as
  the change it is undoing.
  
I encourage you to follow along with the example.  Open up `*scratch*`
and bind `undo-only` to an easy to press key; you don't want to use
`M-x` for this.

First, insert some text

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o
     
Each node represents a buffer state.  Each buffer state will be
labeled with a letter.  For convenience, type `a RET` to move to state
A.  The `RET` is an easy way to make Emacs set a break in the undo
chain; otherwise Emacs will group contiguous inserts into one ""state"".
Also, this state A is actually two states, the ""inserted a"" and
""inserted RET"" states.  In this example, each undo will actually be
two undos, one to undo the `RET` and one to undo the letter.

After following the above, your buffer should look like this:

    a
    b
    c

Next, undo twice:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 /
                o

You are now back at state A.  Note how the undo chain is presented
here.  The undos have been added to the end of the undo chain,
however, the chain is now going backward temporally.  We type some
more:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!

Still simple.  We keep going:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    / F  G  H
          Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                           /
                          / I  J
                Insert!  o--o--o

It's getting complex now; we'll start calling `undo-only` now:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    / F  G  H
          Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                           /
                          / I  J
                Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                              /
                      F  G   /
                      o--o--o
                         
Our first `undo-only` goes back one state to state I.  So far so good.
                         
Our second `undo-only` goes back one state to state G.  So far so good.
                         
Our third `undo-only` goes back three states to state F.  However, we
only went back only one state ""temporally"": we skipped all intervening
undo/redo pairs.

We keep going.

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    / F  G  H
          Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                           /
                          / I  J
                Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                              /
                   D  F  G   /
                   o--o--o--o
                  /
                A/
                o

Now we're all the way back to state A.  With `undo`, we would have had
to traverse every single state (count them, there's a lot), but with
`undo-only`, it only took five.

Now for the final stretch.  We insert a few more fresh states:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    / F  G  H
          Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                           /
                          / I  J
                Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                              /
                   D  F  G   /
                   o--o--o--o
                  /
                A/ K  L
       Insert!  o--o--o

And we undo a whole bunch:

                A  B  C
     Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  E
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    / F  G  H
          Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                           /
                          / I  J
                Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                              /
                   D  F  G   /
                   o--o--o--o
                  /
                A/ K  L
       Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                     /
                    /
                   o
                  /
                 / D  F  G  I  J
    (continue)  o--o--o--o--o--o

Okay, what happened here?  We undid the new states we added, and those
undo actions get added going backward temporally.  After that though,
we started undoing undos.  These undo changes get added with the
reverse temporality as the original changes, so these undo changes are
going forward temporally.  If you did `undo-only` at this point, you
would undo these changes.

(But wait, aren't these changes undo changes? `undo-only` doesn't undo
undos, right?  Well, these changes are actually undos of undos, so
they're actually redos, not undos, hence why they move forward
temporally.)

That's it for the example.  Keep in mind however that this ""undo
chain"" is just a concept to help understand how undo works.  What
Emacs actually stores is `buffer-undo-list`.  You can check it out
with `describe-variable`.

If you have been following along with the example, the state of
`buffer-undo-list` should be like below.  I have annotated it with
points from the undo chain diagrams.

Finally finally, undo records for undos (redos) are stored in
`undo-equiv-table`.  Again, feel free to check it out.

"So I've been twiddling with Emacs 26.1's TLS settings lately to be able to send email to smtp.gmail.com, and I've discovered that I might as well be naked on the Internet.

First of all, now that GnuTLS is required* (not really, but that's the direction we are heading, since `tls.el` and `starttls.el` have just been deprecated on master), I can't switch to OpenSSL anymore. Why you may ask? This is why:

               ""https://sha1-2017.badssl.com/""))

This is tested with `gnutls 3.5.18`, configured with `--with-gnutls`, and `gnutls-trustfiles` set to OpenSSL's `cert.pem`.

Back in the days when I didn't link `gnutls` into Emacs, I would set `tls-program` to `openssl s_client -connect %h:%p -no_ssl3 -no_ssl2 -ign_eof -CAfile %t`, and all of the above would print `nil`. Now that `gnutls` is blessed, 7 of the above tests failed and with no recourse. The revoked, pinning and sha1 intermediate chain tests failing are especially concerning. 3des has also been disabled in OpenSSL for 2 years.

Second of all, what the fuck is up with the default settings? `tls-checktrust` is `nil` by default, `gnutls-verify-error` is `nil` by default, and `gnutls-min-prime-bits` is `256` by default for crying out loud. I know MS-DOS is still sort of supported by Emacs but security isn't something you can stay in the stone age.

This is serious people. Emacs is basically a glorified REPL with no sandboxing. Whatever you install with `package.el` is immediately activated, which means arbitrary code gets eval'ed without you even having a chance to audit it. We can't have RMS prefixing every email with 

    [[[ To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider    ]]]
    [[[ whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies,     ]]]
    [[[ foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example. ]]]

"If you've been following magit development, you may be aware that one of the goals of ""the year of magit"" is to implement Emacs bindings for libgit2, so that magit can avoid using git as a subprocess for every little thing. (There are a lot of little things.) This is the biggest performance bottleneck in magit.

The work-in-progress library is here: https://github.com/magit/libegit2

There are about 700 functions in libgit2 ([list](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD)), most of those are up for grabs and any help in getting these implemented would be appreciated. The readme has instructions for how to get set up and how to go about implementing them. Since it's written in C, some knowledge of C is handy, but if you're a beginner don't fret. It's pretty formulaic work and I've implemented about 50 functions already, there should be some prior art for you to follow.

"Another week, another trick. For this week, I wanted to give you an overview of my organization with the `org-mode` to be in continuity with the [previous tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/98nkt6/tip_how_do_i_synchronize_my_org_files_with_my/).

**NOTE:** there's no code on this post, since I don't have anything magical to present. Also, I know that a lot of posts already exist about how to be organized with `org-mode`, but I figured one more wouldn't hurt 😊

First and foremost, you need to know why nowadays it is more important than before to be organized. Well, we live in a world where everything has to go fast while limiting stress and increasing our productivity. We can say that organization is the way we can be productive by saving time, while limiting our stress.

Personally, it's been 5 years since I started being organized with `org-mode` and I must admit that it was difficult because we quickly tend to give up when the organization is screwed up for some reason. I started by wanting to be organized because I noticed that the most successful people are organized. This organization is mainly done through time and money management.

Even if I am not always satisfied with the level I have to manage my organization, when I look at the person I was 5 years ago, I am pleased to have made efforts to improve it. Remember that your time is your most valuable asset.

That being said, it is important that you know yourself before you want to start an organization that you will not respect.

The questions you should ask yourself are the following:

1. How much sleep do I need to not feel tired?
2. Am I more of a morning or evening person?
3. How much time can I concentrate on a task?
4. Why would I want to improve my organization?

Once you have those answers, then you can organize your schedule around that.

For the setup of my organization in `org-mode`, here are the people on whom I take inspiration and that I suggest you:

* Sacha Chua;
* alphapapa;
* Nicolas Petton;
* John Wiegley.

In addition to that, I tend to follow [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91)'s advices like writing 3 evening tasks to do for the next day and tidying up our workspace every night so that it is already operational.

From a file structure point of view, here is what I use:

* **agenda**: includes all files related to `org-agenda`.

These files are as follows:

1. `calendar.org`: contains events related to special days. In short, this file contains  `%%(org-calendar-holiday)` to display special event days and `%%(org-contacts-anniversaries)` to display my contacts' birthdays.
2. `contacts.org`:  contains the details of my contacts ([read more on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8toivy/tip_how_to_manage_your_contacts_with_orgcontacts/)). For the headers used, I use: *Business*, *Family*, *Family Friends* and *Friends*.
3. `organizer.org`: contains the entries from tasks that need to be refile. I try as much as possible that every week, this file is empty of tasks. For the headers used, I use: *Tasks* and *When...*
4. `people.org`: contains the entries from people-related tasks. For the headers used, I use: *Family*, *Family Friends*, *Friends*, *Meetups*, *Tasks*.
5. `review.org`: contains weekly and monthly reviews. My reviews mainly consist in rereading the daily entries of my journal and completing them with a report made by `org-clock-report` in order to note my productivity (*e.g.* by noting the time spent to study, personal projects, playing, watch series, *etc.*).                                                                                               **NOTE:** one of my desires, is to be able to draw a circle graph generated with `TikZ` in `LaTeX` which would take the column names present in the table and display in percentage the time spent on each task in order to have a visual aspect ([something like shown here](http://www.texample.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/pie-chart-color.png)). If any of you have an idea to do that, I would be very interested 😊
6. `routine.org`: contains my daily tasks. For the headers used, I use: *Every day*, *Once a week*, *Once a month*, *Once a quarter*, *Once a year* and *When...*
7. `school.org`: contains the entries from school-related tasks.                                                                                                     **NOTE:** this file is temporary, since I'm still a student. It will be replaced by `work.org` once I have a permanent work.

* **archives**: includes the task archives of my `org` files. I try to archive every week to avoid polluting my `org` files with finished tasks and that I no longer intend to pay attention to it.

The archiving structure I currently use is as follows:

    - 2018
      - organizer.org_archive
      - people.org_archive
      - review.org_archive
      - school.org_archive
    ...

However, I would like to change to something more structured as follows:

    - 2018
      - january
        - week1
          - organizer.org_archive
          - people.org_archive
          - review.org_archive
          - school.org_archive
        ...
      ...
    ...

* **courses**: includes `org` files related to my courses. I tend to create one large `org` file per course. The reason why I prefer to use `org` for my classes is that I write faster with a keyboard than with a pen.
* **journal:** includes `org` files related to `org-journal` ([read more on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8kz8dv/tip_how_i_use_orgjournal_to_improve_my/)).
* **ledger:** includes `org` files related to `ledger` ([read more on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8x4xtt/tip_how_i_use_ledger_to_track_my_money/)).
* **other:** includes `org` files that couldn't find their place in the other files (*e.g.* `books.org`, `learning.org`, *etc.*)
* **summaries:** includes `org` files which includes summaries on subjects I liked and problem solving (*e.g.* crypt external hard drive, root phone, *etc.*).

**NOTE:** recently, I'm using `git` to do control management with my `org` files. Which helps, if I do a misusing manipulation with my files.

​This tip was the last of 17 previously posted. I intend to pause the time with these posts until I update myself to be able to propose more content. I want to thank you for all your support, I hope that I was able to help you in one way or another because you helped me a lot with your advices. Feel free to give your tips in the comments about your organization 🐈

"Hi!

I just started exploring Emacs and it brought me joy, like a cool new toy (on the scale of the international space station). Being burned out and depressed lately, this ""hobby"" helped me a lot for some reason, it re-ignited a passion for tools and programming.

I decided to start a little experimental podcast to document my exploration. Hopefully, this could be interesting and/or useful for beginners and maybe even experienced users.

Two episodes are ready:

1. Episode 1: obsession with tools and how I developed a good mindset for learning Emacs. *[Listen online](http://emacscast.rakhim.org/episode/dad4f44c-901d-469b-8a8a-a4a890933ac2) / [download mp3](https://pinecast.com/listen/dad4f44c-901d-469b-8a8a-a4a890933ac2) /  [listen on YouTube](https://youtu.be/7vC8al1ZZz8).*

- Org mode (huge topic!)
    - organizing life from scratch
    - migrating from ToDo apps, notes apps, etc
    - setting up an external brain
    - writing blogs (jekyll), articles and books
    - overview of mobile companion apps
- Why bother with Emacs (aside from the usual rhetoric)
- Setup for writers/non-programmers
- Setups for Rails, Clojure, JS
- Migrating from Sublime Text
- Interviews with members of the community (?)
- How to find good resources for beginners: Emacs, Org Mode, configs.

My name is Ag, my Twitter handle is [@iLemming](https://twitter.com/iLemming) and I'm known there as ""M-x tips"".

I've been thinking about it lately. **We do need to hold an Emacs conference**. I have some ideas but I have no clue how to actually get it done. This is extremely arduous task but I think it can be done. And I have never, ever done anything like that before so I really need your help.

First and foremost - I need to know if it is viable at all. Can we gather enough volunteers willing to present? We need 8-10 presentations each at least 30 min long, discussing interesting things and future development of Emacs, not just: ""oh, look! This is awesome little package I wrote, Emacs is totally dope!"".

Then there are thousand other things that need to be thought, ranging from logistics to sponsorship, t-shirts and other swag, tickets, location, venue and etc. etc. I have some ideas (this is going to be the US based, 1-day conference)

"For a while one of the biggest complaints people had about Projectile was that the alien indexing wasn't fast enough (especially on big projects). The reason for this was pretty simple - even though Projectile would normally obtain the list of project files pretty fast (e.g. by using `git ls-files`) it always did some post-processing of the results (e.g. filtering, sorting, etc), which is a very slow operation in Elisp on a big dataset. 

Today [I've added a new indexing method](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/commit/e3007ae0324fb6679a6b3dac5c63191ce907115e) that simply dispenses with all of the post-processing and gives you the raw power you always craved for. It's called `'turbo-alien` and it's going to be the default indexing method going forward. 

Enjoy!

"Another week, another trick. This week, a little longer TIP where I will explain my way of using the `ledger`, this powerful double-entry accounting system that is available on the command line and with GNU Emacs.

[Overview of ledger with its budgeting](https://i.redd.it/r9s1i9pzuu811.png)

The screenshot above gives you an idea of how to manage transactions and view your monthly/annual budget.

Before going any further, here is a simple configuration that you can use for `ledger` with GNU Emacs:

      (use-package ledger-mode
        :mode (""\\.dat\\'""
               ""\\.ledger\\'"")
        :custom (ledger-clear-whole-transactions t))
           
      (use-package flycheck-ledger :after ledger-mode)

**NOTE:** in order to use `ledger`, it must be installed with your operating system.

I mainly use `ledger` to manage my budget using the [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/) principle. Without going into details, it allows me to create several budgets (debts, goals, main, obligations) to more easily save money and allow a better management of it. Being still a student, I use an annual budget, but it's up to you to make it monthly.

Here is what my `budgeting.dat` file looks like:

**NOTE:** certain values are at 0 like having to pay for electricity, water, *etc.* because I still live with my parents. Nevertheless I added this in my budget to facilitate its evolution. For those who might wonder, these values are of course fictitious.

To automatically crediting budget accounts when spending money,  I use 4 respective files: `auto-debts.dat`, `auto-goals.dat`, `auto-main.dat` and `auto-obligations.dat`, in an `auto-transaction` folder

Without showing you all the files, here is for example what the `auto-goals.dat` file contains:

    = /Expenses:Education/
        [Assets:Budget Goals:Education]             -1.0
        [Assets:Budget Goals:Unbudgeted]             1.0
    
    = /Expenses:Fitness/
        [Assets:Budget Goals:Fitness]               -1.0
        [Assets:Budget Goals:Unbudgeted]             1.0
    
    = /Expenses:Vacation/

**NOTE:** all other files have the same principle. For those who want more information, I refer you to the `ledger` documentation about [automated transactions](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Automated-Transactions).

For my transactions, I keep them in a `ledger-xxxx.dat` file where `xxxx` represents the current year (*e.g.* 2018).

Finally, all these `ledger` files are included in a single file named `ledger.dat`:

    ; Automatically crediting budget accounts when spending money.
    include auto-transactions/auto-debts.dat
    include auto-transactions/auto-goals.dat
    include auto-transactions/auto-main.dat
    include auto-transactions/auto-obligations.dat
    
    ; Related to the budget.
    include budgeting.dat
    
    ; Main files.
    include ledger-2018.dat

Sexy, isn't it? 😊

Using `org-capture` it is very simple to add a bank or cash transaction:

    (use-package org-capture
      :ensure nil
      :after org
      :preface
      (defvar my/org-ledger-card-template ""%(org-read-date) %^{Payee}
      Expenses:%^{Account}  €%^{Amount}
      Liabilities:CreditsCards:Belfius"" ""Template for credit card transaction with ledger."")
    
      (defvar my/org-ledger-cash-template ""%(org-read-date) * %^{Payee}
      Expenses:%^{Account}  €%^{Amount}
      Assets:Cash:Wallet"" ""Template for cash transaction with ledger."")
     :custom
      (org-capture-templates
       `((""l"" ""Ledger"")
         (""lb"" ""Bank"" plain (file ,(format ""~/.personal/ledger/ledger-%s.dat"" (format-time-string ""%Y""))),
          my/org-ledger-card-template
          :empty-lines 1
          :immediate-finish t)
         (""lc"" ""Cash"" plain (file ,(format ""~/.personal/ledger/ledger-%s.dat"" (format-time-string ""%Y""))),
          my/org-ledger-cash-template

"About year ago I migrated my blog from Wordpress to Ghost, and for some reason, I needed to edit the exported XML file (6.3 MB) to do a search & replace across it. In that time I was using an electron-based editor, so all attempts to open the file and edit it failed.

I remembered the Linux traditional editors and how robust they are, so I determined to gave Emacs a chance. After installing it, I used the File menu to open that file and... Oh! The file opened immediately! I searched online for how to do my task and just in a few minutes everything was done.

It was a great moment; I thought ""ya, we have wonderful editors in our Linux distros repositories, they're much better than relying on a third-party product, whose company has a troubled relationship with FLOSS community,"" thus I decided to learn Emacs.

Long story short, I read ""Mastering Emacs,"" and learned to use `C-h` commands, gradually I moved to Emacs as my coding tool (for front-end development), and I'm getting more familiar with other great modes like org, dired, mu4e, elfeed, etc.

I loved how Emacs is a text-based interface to accomplish many of computing tasks. Emacs turns me into a text-oriented person. I loved the power of dealing with everything as text. BTW I switched my blog later form Ghost to a static site based on org files.

**I just want to say Big Thanks to everyone here**; I asked many questions in this subreddit, read and followed a lot of helpful discussions and personal experiences. Emacs makes doing staff much more fun and productive.

"It was an excellent book. I had been using Emacs consistently for 10 months. I felt pretty confident in my skills before reading the book but I still found a lot of valuable information in it. $40 is pretty steep in my opinion, and you will have to decide if that is worth it to you. For me it was. Some topics that were introduced have so much depth that I will need to reread them a few times to understand fully.


I really appreciate Mickey Peterson for writing the book, and those who have taken the time to make Emacs self documenting. M-x info-apropos, C-h m (One of my favorites) C-h i, C-h k, C-h f, are my best friends now. I knew most of them existed, but having someone hold my hand and show me how to use them to get the answers I needed got me using them more.

I learned a lot but now I feel overwhelmed. In the book there is a quote by Neal Stephenson from,  In the Beginning... was the Command Line.
> Emacs outshines all other editing soft-
>ware in approximately the same way that the
>noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger
>and brighter; it simply makes everything else
>vanish.


Without trying to start another editor war, what I get from this is ""Emacs is big"". But we all knew that. I knew that before I read the book. People make fun of Emacs for it. But when you really get down into the weeds you realize how *big* that big is. The Emacs Manual is 635 pages long, Mastering Emacs is 281 pages long, The pdf for just org mode is 303 pages long, the emacs lisp reference manual is 1165 pages long (to be fair it's an entire programming language). There are thousands of functions, a plethora of keybindings, and you can access most of them straight from the editor itself. Do you need to read all of this to get up and running in Emacs, no that's absurd. But if you take the time to learn, Emacs will reward you with a little time saving nuggets and useful features you never knew existed. 

Anyway I just wanted to share with everyone. No one I know around me uses Emacs so I don't get to talk about it with anyone at school or work. Again you have to decide if a $40 pdf on Emacs is useful to you. I can tell you that all the information in the book is in Emacs itself. Sometimes it's just nice to have someone find it an lay it out for you.",18,96,Just finished reading Mastering Emacs,emacs
"At the end of October, [I am giving full control of PHP Mode to the
Emacs PHP
group](https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode/issues/365#issuecomment-332065223).
This decision comes on the heels of my own recent health announcements
and, more specifically, unexpectedly ending up in the hospital the
past week.  I was in the middle of working on addressing some
pull-requests when it happened, and it made me realize that it will be
better for the project if I bow out sooner than later, so that one or
more people with more time can give the project the care it deserves.
It is becoming increasingly clear that I can no longer do that.

Some weeks ago I posted about looking for new maintainers due to my
health problems with my failing kidneys.  Since then I have learned
that I have no serious chance of getting a transplant, so I would like
to spend my final 18--36 months doing other things; and before you get
angry at any doctors or whatever, I must disclose that I have a
history of drug addiction involving opiates and heorin.  It is
completely understandable that I would be placed very low on the
transplant list since ""they"" (i.e. the people who make those lists)
have understandable concerns that I might squander away the
opportunity given to me, and I do not blame or begrudge them over that
whatsoever.

Anyway, this post isn't really about me, despite me rambling about
myself.  I do not intend to use this subreddit as a soapbox.  I simply
wanted to post news about the future of PHP Mode.  The point of this
post is to inform everyone that *anyone* interested in PHP Mode for
GNU Emacs should:

1. Support the [Emacs PHP group](https://github.com/emacs-php) in
   general.
   
2. Support Usami Kenta in particular, because he looks to be the most
   likely future maintainer, a role I personally believe he would
   perform very well at.

3. Have an open dialog about what will be best for PHP Mode moving
   forward.  PHP is one of those programming languages so popular that
   GNU Emacs *needs* great support for it, in my opinion.  And between
   PHP Mode and [Web Mode](http://web-mode.org/), that support is
   great.  But the community can't rest of its laurels.  We have to
   always strive to think about what we can do better for the user.

Sorry for the perhaps too-personal, soapbox-ish rant, when really this
is about PHP Mode and not me.  But I simply wanted to explain why I am
turning over ownership of the project a month from now and I believed
it was important to *first* start a public discussion about it and
then see where it goes from there.

**Edit:** The recent news regarding Magit has shown that the Emacs community can do a wonderful job of rallying around in support of useful projects.  The situation is different here, but I suspect (almost) every PHP developer using Emacs is using PHP Mode and/or Web Mode.  I want to see that community---the one that so wonderfully helped Magit---step up and do something similar for PHP Mode, and I'm not talking money or donations (although I'm not saying don't consider that either).  I just know that this community is capable of great things when it can rally together behind a common cause.

Hi everybody, org-web is a project I've been working on for a couple years that was born out of my desire to be able to view and directly edit my org files from my phone. It's a web app, so it'll work on any device with a web browser.

&#x200B;

I posted it here about a year ago, but have since rebuilt it from the ground up and [open sourced it](https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web). I've also added some new features like capture templates and native support for tables, plain lists, checkboxes, and statistics cookies (i.e. \[3/5\] and \[60%\]), and I'm continuing to actively develop it.

&#x200B;

You can view and edit a sample org file without signing in, or sign in with Dropbox (I don't store your credentials anywhere) and use org-web with your own files. You can also easily host the project yourself if you prefer - there's no backend to configure, just some static files to serve (though you'll need to set up a free Developer account on Dropbox).

&#x200B;

I really hope org-web proves as useful to you as it has been for me, and I'd love to hear any feedback you have, either here or through a [Github issue](https://github.com/DanielDe/org-web/issues)!",33,93,org-web - A project I'm working on to view and directly edit your org files from your phone,emacs

"I've recently been working a new e-mail interface for Emacs: [mu4e-conversation](https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/mu4e-conversation) (with screenshots).

It's on MELPA already.  I'll package it for Guix soon.  (UPDATE: It's in Guix.)

I've been using it for about a week: it's been a definite never-go-back
productivity booster!

The idea is to display a full thread of e-mails in one single buffer.  This
makes for a much more pleasant e-mail experience when reading through threads:
the transitions are not only smoother, all Emacs functions apply to the entire
thread instead of just one message (e.g. searching).

This idea is not completely new in the world of e-mail client interfaces: Gmail
already does something similar (but worse :p).

What is much more novel however is the dual-view system:

- The linear view: display the e-mails chronologically in a fashion similar to
  Magit's diffs (or Gmail, or your favorite messenger).

- The tree view: display the thread as an Org document where the Org nodes
  correspond to the thread nodes.  Thus the view retains the structure while
  displaying all messages at once.

## Features

- Dual-view: Seemlessly switch between ""linear"" and ""tree"".

- Highlight the text of new (unread) e-mails with a dedicated face.

- Use all Org features from the ""tree"" view: fold nodes, open links, highlight
  quotes and code, fold code, etc.

- In the ""tree"" view, the snippets produced by `message-mark-inserted-region`

        --8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
        foo
        --8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

    are automatically converted to a `#+begin_src` / `#+end_src` Org block.

- Fill long lines with `M-q` (mu4e's original feature).

- Hide cited text with `#` (the ending quoted text + signature): this is much smarter
  than `mu4e-view-toggle-hide-cited` since it does not hide quoted text in
  inline answers.

- Search an entire thread at once (think `helm-occur` or the Ivy equivalent).

- View several threads at the same time (`M-x rename-buffer` to save a view).

- Use sender-specific faces, e.g. Alice is in yellow, Bob is in green, you are
  in white.

- You can color backgrounds instead of fonts if you'd rather have a more
  ""smartphone messenger"" look.

- [Evil Collection](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection) bindings coming soon.  (UPDATE: It's in Evil Collection now.)

## Development

In principle, this concept could be implemented on top of any Emacs mail client
(Gnus, notmuch...).  I've done it for mu4e since it's the client I use.
I'm curious to whether this could be easily ported to other e-mail interfaces.

Since it's still relatively new, there might some rough edges here and there
(especially missing bindings and Org syntax).
Please report! :)

Code reviews are very welcome.  I'd also need recommendation when it comes to
formatting e-mails as Org documents.  For instance, should we use `: ` for
quotes (instead of `> `)?



## A call for better e-mail interfaces

I believe the reason that e-mails are often looked down upon is mostly due to
the overwhelming presence of poorly designed user interfaces.

The ""conversation view"" feature is vital to most users.  I think it's partly
what keep users tied up so loyally to the social media platform of the moment
(Facebook, Whatsapp, <insert-the-next-popular-messenger-here>).

Gmail is possibly the most popular e-mail interface and that might be thanks to
its feature of something close to a ""conversation"" view.  That said, Gmail
thread view is not as convenient (e.g. messages folded by default, lack of
controls) and it can't display from a tree view.

Most other clients cannot display more than an e-mail at once on screen (tabs
are a poor approach to navigate a thread).

That said, `mu4e-conversation` is not completely finished yet.
Currently `mu4e-conversation` does not allow for in-buffer replies, but I would
love to add this feature at some point.  (UPDATE: see below.)

A brilliant aspect about e-mails is that it does not brandlock users: they are free
to save their e-mails anywhere and use the interface of their choice.
If we value the freedom to own and control our communication data, I think it's
important to steer away from locked-down platforms and use more open protocols.
Making e-mails more attractive would be an important step forward in that direction.

## UPDATE: In-buffer replies

I've just pushed a massive set of changes: it basically allows you to reply to the thread within the buffer itself.  Go to the end of the buffer and start writing, then press `C-c C-c` (`mu4e-conversation-send`).  It makes for a decent ""messenger"" experience and saves some more window/buffer switches.

You can also press `RET` (`mu4e-conversation-cite`) and it will append the corresponding citation to the composition area.

There are still many rough edges I'm working on (like recipient selection, keybindings and read-only areas), so please send some feedback when you've got time! :)",34,90,mu4e-conversation: Single buffer full-thread display to make e-mails great again!,emacs

"Hi guys

I just develop a new framework [https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework)

**Emacs Application Framework is a development framework that developers can develop any PyQt program and integrate into Emacs.**

This framework mainly implements three functions:

1. Integrate PyQt program window into Emacs Frame using Xlib Reparent technology
2. Listening to EAF buffer's keyboard event flow and controlling the keyboard input of PyQt program via DBus IPC
3. Created a window compositer to make the PyQt program window adapt Emacs's Window/Buffer design

Using this framework, you can use PyQt develop powerful graphics programs to extend Emacs

1. This approach grates against the Elisp coding conventions...

  > • You should choose a short word to distinguish your program from
 other Lisp programs.  The names of all global symbols in your
 program, that is the names of variables, constants, and functions,
 should begin with that chosen prefix.  Separate the prefix from the
 rest of the name with a hyphen, ‘-’.  This practice helps avoid
 name conflicts, since all global variables in Emacs Lisp share the
 same name space, and all functions share another name space(1).
 Use two hyphens to separate prefix and name if the symbol is not
 meant to be used by other packages.

  above from `(info ""(elisp) Coding Conventions"")`

2. It breaks `custom-unlispify-tag-names` which is used to display customize pages without the mode prefix.

3. It breaks autocompletion, at least in the mini-buffer, where the user expects <space> translated to hyphen to work as a universal delimiter.

4. Most importantly, it breaks user expectation long established by code that properly follows the conventions that symbols ought to take the form `PREFIX-some-symbol`.

"I have managed to procure a copy of Dan Weinreb's thesis: A Real-Time Display-Oriented Editor for the Lisp Machine.  It has less information of the type I had hoped for, but I still found it worth reading.  Given the expense, I can't recommend it to any others than to people especially interested in the history of Emacs and Lisp Machines.  Below are some of my notes on parts I found interesting.  I've provided some manually transcribed quotations, and have used ellipses and such to indicate omissions of bits I thought unnecessary for my purposes, and paraphrased a few omitted bits indicated with square brackets.  I could easily have made typos though.

First, a few general words about the paper.  I procured it from MIT Document Services.  It is unlisted in their catalogue, but you can still request it by writing to them and specifically requesting it.  I believe the delay in their cataloguing of it is due to questions of the legality of listing it without the (now unobtainable) permission of the author (deceased), though that is just my speculation.  It is 34 pages long, including all front and back matter.  It is missing a diagram, which I believe was lost in the microfilming process.  Each page bears the date 31-JAN-79.

To forestall requests for me to provide copies to people: I am not going to do that, in part because MIT Document Services really exerted themselves to get this for me. Multiple people on their staff searched for it after I pestered them, and it was eventually found in an uncatalogued reel of microfilm.  I certainly cannot justify denying them the paltry income that their existence must be in part justified by to distribute it in that way.  However, if someone has a question they think might be answered by the thesis but which I have not talked about here, comment or send me a message and I will answer as best I can.

Here's the abstract:

> ZWEI is a real-time display-oriented editor, written for the Lisp Machine.  It is display-oriented in that the text being edited is displayed on the screen at all times; it is real-time in that commands are executed as soon as they are given.  The result is an extremely interactive and efficient kind of editing.  This kind of editor has become very popular in widespread parts of the MIT computer community, and has been found to be easy to use yet extremely powerful.  This thesis describes the user interface presented by ZWEI, and explains how ZWEI was implemented.  An emphasis is placed on the way the nature of the Lisp Machine system affected ZWEI's design.


The thesis consists of four chapters:

1. Introduction, Explanation of what the Lisp Machine System is
2. Description of ZWEI's user interface, rationale, how the nature of the Lisp Machine affects the interface
3. Explanation of the implementation strategies used, emphasis on engineering trade-offs
4. Discussion of the future of the system


Here are my notes on the thesis.  Some familiarity with the Emacs of today, and of Lisp, is presumed:


**1)  Introduction**

Note that when the Lisp Machine software was being built, they had written a similar editor called EINE (a recursive acronym: EINE Is Not Emacs), and that they were in the middle of writing a new version called ZWEI (ZWEI Was EINE Initially).
> This thesis is written in anticipation of the completion of the conversion effort, and describes ZWEI as it will be when the rest of EINE is converted over.

Some paragraphs are devoted to what must have been a novel concept at the time for such a system: that the Lisp Machine was a personal system, not time-shared, and this gave rise to features not viable on time-sharing systems, due to the fact that the user was not contending with other users for resources.

> The Lisp Machine terminal consists of two input devices, called the keyboard and the mouse, and one output device called the TV.

It was noted that the keyboard had control and meta keys, and that those two as well as shift could be used in conjunction with regular keys to form chords.  The mouse got a whole paragraph, since mice were relatively new at the time.  The mouse had three buttons.  The TV was a raster-scan device of approximately one million black/white pixels.  Emphasis was made of the (for the time) particularly good resolution, so many more characters could be displayed, compared to other contemporary terminals.


**2) The User Interface**

The users of the system at the time were researchers at the MIT AI Lab.  They had two principal uses for a text editor: 1) producing and debugging Lisp code, and 2) writing English text in the form of academic papers, email, and such.  It was predicted that most users would spend half their time working with the editor.

One of the most important considerations of ZWEI's user interface were compatibility with the PDP-10's interactive editors, so with ITS EMACS.

ZWEI is display-oriented: the text the user is editing is actually displayed (this is relevant because many editors of the time often showed out-of-date text due to efficiency and bandwidth restrictions, putting the burden on the user to imagine what their text looks like currently).
ZWEI is real-time: each command takes effect immediately, and the displayed text is updated immediately.  The update is called redisplay.

As with modern Emacs, ZWEI had a point and a cursor.

Some explanation is given of self-insertion for typing ASCII characters, control commands being given via control characters, and notes that numeric arguments can be provided to modify commands.  He specifically calls out the feature of self-documentation, and that Control-? can be used to access describe-key, and alludes to the existence of other commands like C-h a.  There are some other features and modes he describes, but they are commonplace things any current Emacs user will either know of or find easily.

> Since ZWEI is written in Lisp and lives in the Lisp environment of the Lisp machine, it is in a very good position to interface closely with other elements of that environment.

He does not specifically mention this, but this would not be elisp, it would be the native Lisp which would be MacLisp, and later generations would be Zetalisp and even Common Lisp.

He also mentions that the graphical capabilities of the display allowed the use of different typefaces or fonts, specifically italic and bold, as well as varying sizes and styles, and that these can all be mixed in a buffer.

Regions could be marked with the mouse, as well as through the keyboard-based methods, by holding the left mouse button down whilst moving from one end of the region to the other.  The middle mouse button could mark words or lists at a time, and the right button was reserved for the system.

> The use of the mouse is still considered experimental.  We know of several editors which depend highly on the use of a mouse for input, but we are not convinced that it is better than a keyboard; after more people start using ZWEI, it will be interesting to see how many of them make heavy use of the mouse and how many hardly use it at all.


**3) The Implementation**

> The Lisp Machine's unusual nature played a pervasive role in the design of ZWEI.  The first question, in what language should ZWEI be written, was instantly answered: Lisp.  Since everything in the Lisp Machine is written in the Lisp language, the choice was clear.  The only question was whether some intermediate language should be written in Lisp, and ZWEI written in the intermediate language.
>
>However, it seemed that Lisp Machine Lisp was a sufficiently powerful and comfortable environment for writing a text editor that no intermediate language would be needed.

A pervasive theme throughout this section was that because the Lisp Machine was a dedicated single-user machine, many constraints that influenced the design of previous editors running on terminals connected to time-sharing machines were not an issue.

A lot of this section is devoted to the nuts-and-bolts of the representation and handling of text, but not much about the relations between the various conceptual objects like buffers and modes.

> Text in ZWEI is represented as a doubly-linked list of lines.
The structure that represents a line has the text itself, its length, a list of buffer pointers, a tick representing the last time the line was modified, and of course previous and next line.  An associated structure is a buffer-pointer (bp), which is associated with a line, an index of a character within the line, and a status which is one of {normal, moves, temp} (more on this later).  The point and mark, for example, are represented as bps, though they are by no means the only bps.

> ZWEI provides a large number of functions for the manipulation of text, and the arguments used to designate positions in text are buffer pointers.
>
> There are also a wide variety of positioning commands, which take a bp pointing to some text and return a new bp that points some number of characters ahead of the given pointer, or words or lines or Lisp lists or sentences ahead of the given pointer.  The ZWEI user commands are all built out of these functions.
>
> Every time an insertion or deletion takes place, all buffer pointers are adjusted, or relocated, so that they continue to point at the same point relative to the text.

The status attribute of bps mentioned above is used to indicate how a bp should be updated if the insertion or deletion happens right where the bp was pointing.  The normal status means the index is unchanged by insertions before it, the moves status means that the bp is moved to the end of the inserted text.  The temporary bp is used for intermediate bps that don't live long enough to be affected by insertions or deletions.  These bps do not get put in the data structure that is searched for updatable bps upon insertions or deletions.

A third data structure is the interval, which has two components: first-bp and last-bp.  Its content is the text between the two.  The first-bp is normal, so it does not move, and the last-bp is a moves bp, so insertions and deletions in the interval cause the last-bp to move to accommodate.

Some discussion was made of the redisplay algorithm, and how it is different from those generally in use at the time, due to the Lisp Machine being a single-user machine:
> In the Lisp Machine, there tends to be lots of spare computation power lying around for interactive problems. ... Sacrifices were made ... in exchange for simplicity and elegance in the redisplay routines.

**3.5) Organization of the Code**

This section contains some of the most worthwhile bits of the whole paper, to me.  It talks more of generalities, lessons learned, design principles, and such.

> A great deal of programming experience in the past few years has pointed out a peril in the writing of large programs: complexity.  When a program gets very large, and the job done by the program is elaborate and takes some time to explain, the program can get so complex that nobody could possibly keep all of it in his head at once.  When a program is very large and complex, it becomes hard to maintain, modify, improve, or debug.

> ... we used several interesting techniques in the coding to keep ZWEI clear and simple.  Some of these techniques were only possible because of the powerful features of the Lisp macro facility.

ZWEI predates things like Flavors and LOOPS, not to mention CLOS, so structures were used, and macros and macro-defining-macros were used to decouple the instantiation and access to those structures from their representation.

> Lisp macros were also useful for the definition of new control structures, as well as new data structures.  In ZWEI, we created a new iterative control structure called **charmap**, which iterates over characters in an interval.  Intervals are stored as doubly-linked lists of arrays, and the starting point might be in the middle of one array and the ending point might be in the middle of another array.  The code to perform this iteration was not trivial, and someone reading it might easily not understand the function it was performing, even though that function was the conceptually simple one of iterating over characters.  So we created a macro called **charmap** that expands into the double-loop code to iterate over the characters.  It is simple and obvious, and is used in many places, greatly reducing the size of the code and making the functionality obvious at a glance.

> A good deal of time was devoted to considering the right way to modularize various functions, providing smooth functional interfaces that worked out well for many different tasks.  This was often difficult, and several times large pieces of code were re-written as better ways of organizing and modularizing became clear.

They thought a lot about the naming of things, when fighting the problems brought about by the proliferation of incompatible abbreviations:
> It became policy to avoid abbreviations in most cases.  In ZWEI, we made a list of several words that were used extremely often, and established 'official' abbreviations for them, and always used only those abbreviations. ... Words not on this list were always spelled out in full.

> [They were] very careful with function names in general, and to establish naming conventions and calling conventions.  For example, all functions that take some action on an interval of text end in '-interval' ... All such functions take the interval as their last required argument, and then accept an optional argument after that.  If the optional argument is not given, then the first argument is an interval.  If the optional argument is given, then the first of the two is the starting bp of the interval, and the second is the ending bp of the interval.

This allowed them to avoid the construction of intermediate aggregate values just to satisfy calling conventions.

> There are several conventions of this type used throughout ZWEI.


**4) The Future**

This section is a couple of pages, and talks about the graphics capabilities and how they allow the use of different typefaces, and also about structured text.

**4.2) Structured Text**

They describe the text editor NLS, which was a structure editor, and talked about how it was an appealing idea, but that ZWEI does not currently do this kind of thing.

"1: Add `(set gc-cons-threshold 100000000)` to the beginning of your init file.

`gc-cons-threshold` is the number of bytes of consing before a garbage collection is invoked. It's normally set at 800,000 bytes, but for me that invokes the GC 39 times!!! during startup (`gcs-done`), and the GC is sloooow. I've set it to ~100MB above, because I have 16 GB of RAM. And now no GC invocations during startup, and 600ms shaved off my startup time.

2: Wrap your init file inside `(let ((file-name-handler-alist nil)) <init file>)`

Normally file-name-handler-alist is set to 

    ((""\\`/[^/]*\\'"" . tramp-completion-file-name-handler)
    (""\\`/[^/|:][^/|]*:"" . tramp-file-name-handler)
    (""\\`/:"" . file-name-non-special))

Which means on every .el and .elc file loaded during start up, it has to runs those regexps against the filename.

This shaved another 200ms off my startup time.

3: Bonus step if you're willing to recompile Emacs

Apply this [diff](https://gist.github.com/bsuh/e7cba8a61f482b8d8687)

Emacs uses `getc` to get characters from a `FILE` handle, when loading .el (and maybe .elc) files. `getc` is thread-safe by using locking mechanisms. Well when you are calling `getc` a lot in a loop and you have a single-threaded process, it doesn't make sense to pay the overhead of locking for thread safety. I replaced `getc` with `getc_unlocked`, and was rewarded with another 200ms shaved init time.

Overall, my startup time went from 1.5 seconds to 0.5 seconds! Happy emacs'ing :)",53,80,2 easy little known steps to speed up Emacs start up time,emacs

"I'm a recent CS grad. My sophomore year I discovered vi. My homework consisted of 1) Tweaking my vi configs 2) Not doing homework. I absolutely loved the efficiency and ergonomics of it. Every time I had a project partner, I felt the extreme superiority over their arrow-driven development.

Then I got a job. I expected to continue to be the hottest guy around. And as I watched the windows guys and their Notepad++/Sublimes, I wasn't proved wrong.

Yet there was that guy. You know, the one in the corner with a hand-made standup desk and a weird Linux distro. The one whose name you see in every file you open, every project you clone. The one that has an aura of mystery around him.

He was an Emacs user. ""Emacs"" I thought? Is that the editor that this old weird professor used? The one who taught an awfully boring theory class? Why?

I checked it out. And oh boy I wasn't dissapointed as he fussy helm find into multi occur to edit multiple files all over a tramp session on a remote machine. ""No way"" I thought.

So I started my Emacs journey. I became this weirdo that doesn't have Atom installed on his machine. The one whose team lead probably secretly hates as I spend too much time hacking elisp. But I've discovered it. This beautiful tree of functions that mapped to keys which you can easily explore and learn about. I've discovered the beauty of Lisp.

There was no turning back to vi, or any editor at that point. An editor junkie finally found his editor nirvana.

Few months passed, and now I'm delving deep into company-mode source code to troubleshoot why help pops up show on the wrong monitor while trying to understand the byte-code printed notation and the hacky way regexes are implemented.

So I'm asking you Emacs gurus - having many years of editors/emacs experience and all the ways it is imperfect and old, is it still the best long term editor choice? Will I regret investing time into learning Emacs well given that there are editors with(as they claim) better and more modern architecture(like NeoVim/Atom?

"Hey there! These last few days I've been rewriting my agenda from scratch and thought that I should share it here, because I have never seen it done like this before.

For contextualization, around February I created one based on [Bernt's agenda](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html). As time passed, I continued adding more and more things to it, as I was adapting my workflow (first time using GTD, so I was learning GTD and org-agenda at the same time!). I have posted about it [in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8d42wu/how_do_you_use_orgmode/dxkf564/) (there's a screenshot).

It had some problems:

* It wasn't fast (not slow either, but well...). As it had lots of different commands, each one with different match strings and skip functions, it had to parse the agenda file several times, and some commands even processed multiple headings to check if one would end up there (for example, for the projects list).
* It was ""a hack"". The best example of this is the projects list, which had to check all the subheadings to know the project status of the parent (stuck, planned, next), and had to change the prefix of each subtask correctly. Also, it inserted [Zero-width spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space) on the top-level projects, in order to make them bold in a finalize hook. Which brings me to the next two points...
* A project was not a project, it was multiple independent headings being analyzed in order, not a structured thing. Which means I couldn't sort it, for example.
* Changing it was hard. Every variable set in `org-agenda-custom-commands` had a reason to be there and, many times, when I found something I didn't like, changing it would introduce unintended changes on other things.

After some time I had an idea of parsing everything myself, obtaining everything I needed in only one go!

In the description, `org-agenda-custom-commands` says that it supports user-defined functions, so that's what I did. I must say, **it wasn't easy**, I had to read lots of functions in `org-agenda` because there was *literally* no documentation in how to write a agenda that will work correctly - there are a lot of different magic text properties that must be set, for example.

I ended up implementing it with `org-element`, with a depth-first algorithm, and I must say it works very well and is faster than the previous one. I hope this serves as a reference if you also want to do it, as it is easier than reading random functions in `org.el` and `org-agenda.el` :D

[The implementation is here](https://github.com/weirdNox/dotfiles/blob/26c5c2739aff28af5ed4d6f243c7ec0e9b581821/config/.emacs.d/config.org#agenda), and here you have an example screenshot with both the Org file and the resulting agenda.

"Hi! I've been a Vim user for most of my programming life, but last year I decided to switch over to emacs + evil mode. I'm really happy with it, Emacs is excellent.

The non-modal way. I wanna at least give it a fair shot, and if nothing else, I enjoy training my brain to become good at using tools like these. 

I've taken to switching over from evil to ""regular emacs"" for about 30 minutes a day after lunch for the few weeks, and I can, slowly, get some regular work done.

You know, C-n/C-p to find the right line, then M-b/M-f to find where I wanna change something, then some random kill commands/typing to get what I want. Sometimes in sheer desperation i just revert to the arrow keys and backspace. It feels clumsy and slow and like I'm not using Emacs like I should. 

One of the major problems is that I don't know what ""effective editing"" in Emacs looks like. What does it look like when somebody who's used Emacs for decades edits a text file in their day-to-day and all the keys are second nature\`? Whenever I try and find a video like that on YouTube, it's always either a talk, or someone teaching the basics very slowly. Which I'm not interested in so much: I want the real pros. I want to see how it SHOULD be done. Preferably in a C-like language, but I'm not picky. It would also be nice to see what keys they are using, but it would be interesting even without that. 

Any recommendations for videos like that?",41,74,"Videos demonstrating ""pro level"" use of emacs for programming?",emacs
"Another week, another trick. For this week, I wanted to put to honor `ivy`,  a generic completion mechanism for GNU Emacs who is a true Swiss Army knife when combined with `counsel` (a collection of Ivy-enhanced versions of common GNU Emacs commands) and `swiper` (Ivy-enhanced alternative to `isearch`). Know that there are other alternatives like `ido` (provided by default with GNU Emacs) and `helm`. After experiencing these three packages, I liked `helm`, but to be honest, I wasn't using all of its features and I was looking for a lighter and faster solution. That's why, it's already a few years since I chose `ivy` and which corresponds entirely to my workflow. Please note that my choice may vary according to your criteria 😊

[Overview of ivy](https://i.redd.it/i1x3l7cpyjb11.png)

The picture above shows the user-friendly interface that `ivy` offers, which is easily customizable since there are many packages created by the community. For instance, when I have to change the buffer, I can directly know its size, the language used, the `.git` repository name and its path. I love it! 😇

A simple and elegant configuration to produce the above result, can be done as follows:

    (use-package counsel
      :after ivy
      :config (counsel-mode))
    
    (use-package ivy
      :defer 0.1
      :diminish
      :bind ((""C-c C-r"" . ivy-resume)
             (""C-x B"" . ivy-switch-buffer-other-window))
      :custom
      (ivy-count-format ""(%d/%d) "")
      (ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)
      :config (ivy-mode))
    
    (use-package ivy-rich
      :after ivy
      :custom
      (ivy-virtual-abbreviate 'full
                              ivy-rich-switch-buffer-align-virtual-buffer t
                              ivy-rich-path-style 'abbrev)
      :config
      (ivy-set-display-transformer 'ivy-switch-buffer
                                   'ivy-rich-switch-buffer-transformer))
    
    (use-package swiper
      :after ivy
      :bind ((""C-s"" . swiper)
             (""C-r"" . swiper)))

Without going into details, this allows you to fully integrate `ivy` with GNU Emacs and already be ready for everyday use.

**NOTE:** `ivy` is always my first interaction when starting GNU Emacs. Using `defer 0.1` avoids waiting a while to launch GNU Emacs before you can interact with it.

Here are some packages you will find useful with `ivy`:

* [all-the-icons-ivy](https://github.com/asok/all-the-icons-ivy): ivy integration for [all-the-icons.el](https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el);
* [ivy-bibtex](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex/blob/master/ivy-bibtex.el): search and manage bibliographies in Emacs;
* [ivy-gitlab](https://github.com/nlamirault/emacs-gitlab/blob/master/ivy-gitlab.el): `ivy` interface to [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/);
* [ivy-hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/ivy-hydra.el): additional key bindings for `ivy`;
* [ivy-pass](https://github.com/ecraven/ivy-pass): `ivy` interface for `pass`.

**NOTE:** You can find the other packages in the list of GNU Emacs packages (`M-x package-list-packages`). Of course, don't forget to integrate the appropriate package sources.

And you, what are your tips to share with `ivy` (or other alternative)? Looking forward to learning more about your workflow with this one! 🐈

"/edit: The multiroot feature are merged into master now.

Hello /r/emacs,

you might remember [treemacs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/tree/multiroot) which I've advertised here a while ago (there's a [changelog](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/blob/multiroot/Changelog.org) now if you're curious what's happened since). 

Now I want to tell you about and get feedback on the Next Big Feature. Long story short treemacs will be moving away from the one-filetree-to-rule-them-all approach and will instead learn to dispay multiple filetrees - projects as I call it - at the same time. Instead of being a better neotree it's now moving in the direction of something like the project explorer of eclipse. The new design will provide much improved flexibility as you will no longer need to rely on creating more frames to have filetrees for multiple disjoint projects at once.

It also opens up the potential for displaying a tree view for something other than the filesystem, like your buffer list, split by major-mode/project/perspective/whatever else.
 
The work for multiple project display, at least a first basic version, is mostly done. What I am hoping to get out of this thread is for you guys to do me the favor is to read the [docs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/tree/multiroot#projects-and-workspaces) or [design discussion](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/10432) or better yet [try the feature branch directly](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/tree/multiroot) and tell me what you think, what's missing, what's buggy etc. The more feedback I get on what people want to see and what they expect before I make the push to master the smoother and less surprising the change to the new version will be, and I'm expecting to break a lot of habits as it is.

If you want to give it a go: the [use-package code](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/tree/multiroot#installation) should work for a local installation, just provide the appropriate `:load-path` (not the package root, but root/src/elisp). Calling `treemacs` for the first time will ask you for the first project's location and name, as it will for all new projects. So far projects can be added, removed and renamed. The keybinds for it start with `C-p`. For everything else there's the helpful hydra bound to `?`.",19,75,Treemacs News,emacs

"[https://github.com/nyyManni/ejira](https://github.com/nyyManni/ejira)

I am sharing a library that I have been working with for a while now. It is still in beta phase, and has some rough edges here and there, but it is mostly usable for me already.

I tried org-jira-mode a few years back, but it never quite suited my use case, for a couple of reasons: the clock marker was always destroyed while syncing the data from the server, as the plugin always overwrote the whole ticket subtree. The performance was also really poor because of the limitation of \~1 requests per second when using the basic auth. Also, all the text content would be in JIRA markup format which does not have good editing capabilities in Emacs.

Ejira resolves the previous issues by doing the synchronization by only updating the body of a block, not the properties or headings. It also uses cookie-based authentication to go around the request frequency limit. The JIRA markup is parsed by a custom parser (JIRA markup, unlike HTML, seems to be somewhat parseable with regular expressions... ;) ), and the outgoing data is exported using ox-jira -library.

The library is not yet on melpa, so manual installation only. Documentation is probably insufficient, but I try to improve it as issues are found.

I have only been able to test with my employer's JIRA server, and our company's workflow, so most likely new issues will arise when someone tries to use the module in their own work.

"TL;DR:

1. Elisp script to install all packages very fast with parallel processes. \[[gif](https://imgur.com/a/pWWZqwK)\]

2. Work with use-package.

&#x200B;

[https://github.com/tttuuu888/.emacs.d/blob/master/install.el](https://github.com/tttuuu888/.emacs.d/blob/master/install.el)

&#x200B;

This is simple elisp script to install all packages very fast with parallel processes. The main ideas are first, making package list with modified `use-package` macro. Second, installing packages with multiple `async-shell-command`.

&#x200B;

This works with 3 conditions.

1. All packages are maintained by 'use-package'

2. `(setq use-package-always-ensure t)` is included in config so that `use-package` for external package does not have `:ensure t` keyword.

ex) 

        (use-package company
            :init
            (global-company-mode 1))   

3. `use-package` with `:ensure` keyword will not be tried to install.(regarded as internal package)

ex) 

        (use-package paren
            :ensure nil
            :init
            (show-paren-mode t))

&#x200B;

You can start this with below command:

    emacs -l ~/.emacs.d/install.el -batch -init

(This will remove \~/.emacs.d/elpa directory and start from scratch. To test, backup the directory beforehand.)

&#x200B;

I have been looking for a way to install all packages faster with minimal dependencies when setting new computer. Then I came up with this idea and wrote this script. Maybe this is not new or there may be a better solution but anyway I wanted share this since I have learned a lot from here.

&#x200B;

I wrote this for personal use at first and updated it for general use, but there may be other conditions that make this script not work properly.

&#x200B;

I hope that this script and ideas are useful somewhere so that others, including myself, will be able to take advantage of it again. Thanks!

"Another week, another trick. This week, I will present you my way of using `erc`, following the recommendation of several people. I apologize in advance for the relatively long post, I just like to be complete so that anyone can understand this post. First, for those who don't know IRC, it's roughly, which allows you to communicate with other people in real time on different channels. IRC is the best way for me to get a quick answer to a simple question and to learn from more competent people than me on a subject. For example, what I like to do when I learn a new language is to join their IRC channel, scan the logs at the end of each day and try to understand the questions with their answers asked. At first, it's confusing, but little by little I am familiar with the vocabulary used.

Before going any further, here is what my `erc` looks like:

[After ERC configuration](https://i.redd.it/0rk9stel5h011.png)

If you're still interested in knowing more, then let's keep going!

The question you need to ask yourself is how to use IRC so that it saves you more time than waste, because we quickly tend to spend our days sailing between the different channels, a bit like on Reddit. For my part, I wanted a configuration that was pleasant to read, targeting only what is necessary to be read and that informs me when someone has answered my question.

Without going into details, here is the beginning of the configuration that I use:

    (use-package erc
      :custom
      (erc-autojoin-channels-alist '((""freenode.net"" ""#archlinux"" ""#bash"" ""#bitcoin""
                                      ""#emacs"" ""#gentoo"" ""#i3"" ""#latex"" ""#org-mode"" ""#python"")))
      (erc-autojoin-timing 'ident)
      (erc-fill-function 'erc-fill-static)
      (erc-fill-static-center 22)
      (erc-hide-list '(""JOIN"" ""PART"" ""QUIT""))
      (erc-lurker-hide-list '(""JOIN"" ""PART"" ""QUIT""))
      (erc-lurker-threshold-time 43200)
      (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password nil)
      (erc-server-reconnect-attempts 5)
      (erc-server-reconnect-timeout 3)
      (erc-track-exclude-types '(""JOIN"" ""MODE"" ""NICK"" ""PART"" ""QUIT""
                                 ""324"" ""329"" ""332"" ""333"" ""353"" ""477""))
      :config
      (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'notifications)
      (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'spelling)
      (erc-services-mode 1)
      (erc-update-modules))

Roughly, this makes it possible to make a nice margin for the display, allow a connection using the password from my `authinfo.gpg` file, avoid warning me when a user joins and leaves a channel, enable notifications and the spell checking on the fly.

Besides, for people like me, who want to store your password in a *GPG* file, you just need to specify a file priority list, to tell `erc` where to start looking for your password first:

    (setq auth-sources '(""~/Sync/shared/.authinfo.gpg""
                         ""~/.authinfo.gpg""
                         ""~/.authinfo""
                         ""~/.netrc""))

and of course, don't forget to add this line in your `.authinfo.gpg` file, where *\<nickname\>* and *\<password\>* match your real information:

    machine irc.freenode.net login <nickname> password <password>

**NOTE:** replace `auth-sources` with the one that suits you best.

If you are still with me, I will list you some functions that I use, which allow to complete the configuration presented above.

– In order to avoid opening several `erc` instances, I use a function that will ensure that only one connection instance exists:

    (defun my/erc-start-or-switch ()
      ""Connects to ERC, or switch to last active buffer.""
      (interactive)
      (if (get-buffer ""irc.freenode.net:6667"")
          (erc-track-switch-buffer 1)
        (when (y-or-n-p ""Start ERC? "")
          (erc :server ""irc.freenode.net"" :port 6667 :nick ""rememberYou""))))

– Another thing that I like, is to automatically receive a notification when I get a private message, or when my nickname is quoted on a channel so I can respond quickly. This notification includes as title the pseudonym of the person as well as his message as content:​​

    (defun my/erc-notify (nickname message)
      ""Displays a notification message for ERC.""
      (let* ((channel (buffer-name))
             (nick (erc-hl-nicks-trim-irc-nick nickname))
             (title (if (string-match-p (concat ""^"" nickname) channel)
                        nick
                      (concat nick "" ("" channel "")"")))
             (msg (s-trim (s-collapse-whitespace message))))
        (alert (concat nick "": "" msg) :title title)))

– One thing that bothered me about `erc` was that I liked to know how many people were on the channel so I could get an idea if I was going to get a quick answer or not. This is done with the following code:

    (defun my/erc-count-users ()
      ""Displays the number of users connected on the current channel.""
      (interactive)
      (if (get-buffer ""irc.freenode.net:6667"")
          (let ((channel (erc-default-target)))
            (if (and channel (erc-channel-p channel))
                (message ""%d users are online on %s""
                         (hash-table-count erc-channel-users)
                         channel)
              (user-error ""The current buffer is not a channel"")))
        (user-error ""You must first start ERC"")))

– From time to time I wanted to copy and paste a source on a channel, and get myself kicked for spam after sending this message several times in a short time. To avoid these problems, this function comes to your rescue:​

    (defun my/erc-preprocess (string)
      ""Avoids channel flooding.""
      (setq str
            (string-trim
             (replace-regexp-in-string ""\n+"" "" "" str))))

– Two other packages I like to use. The first package is `erc-hl-nicks`, which allows me to associate a color with a pseudonym. I find it convenient because it gives me a first visual impression if a person answered. Finally, the second package is `erc-image`, which automatically displays images as links, on a channel. This allows me to avoid having to click on the link to see the image:

    (use-package erc-hl-nicks
      :after erc)
    
    (use-package erc-image
      :after erc)

"I'm happy to announce that we've just released [Next](https://next.atlas.engineer/) browser version 1.2.0!  While some important features are still missing in this alpha (e.g. Download support and VI-style bindings), it's now much more mature and usable.

It is also significantly more hackable than before, with some examples of interactivity with external process (here Emacs) put on display in the following article:

https://next.atlas.engineer/article/emacs-hacks.org

News from the change log:

- Add RELOAD-CURRENT-BUFFER command and bind it to C-r
- Add NEXT-VERSION command

It reports the commit hash if it was not built on a tag version.

- Add cookie support

GTK implementation has per-buffer cookie support.

- Report page load status to echo area
- Add COPY-TITLE command and bind it to M-w
- Add COPY-ANCHOR-URL command and bind it to C-x C-w
- Add COPY-URL command and bind it to C-w
- Add PASTE command to minibuffer and bind it to C-v and C-y
- Add common movement commands to minibuffer

For instance `cursor-forwards-word` is bound to `M-f` by default.

- Add ""echo area"" to display status messaages
- Set window title dynamically
- Embed/Replace build dependencies in the Cocoa port

It now builds out of the box, with no need for external libraries.'

- Add commandline arguments to the Cocoa platform port
- Report user configuration errors
- Save platform logs to /tmp/next-$USER/

Get it from your package manager or from https://next.atlas.engineer/download!  Feel free to register on the download page if you'd like to fill in the survey and participate into steering the future development directions of Next!

"After reading a number of Guile-Emacs threads, [Guile Emacs: Is anyone still working on it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6zavn8/guile_emacs_is_anyone_still_working_on_it/), [Guile Emacs Status? : emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3gpb7u/guile_emacs_status/) I have come to the opinion that the real issue is that as far as being Lisp goes, the Emacs/elisp combo is considered a dead end technology.

The questions that come up are:

1. Based on its underlying design is there a future for Elisp as a LISP outside Emacs and the utilities like Org, Gnus, Magit which have developed around it?

2. Does an Elisp based on the Guile VM offer a better foundation for both Emacs as editor, and for any other Elisp related development than the current system?

3. If the purpose of moving to Guile-based Elisp is mainly to provide an improved editor will it be worthwhile to port all the accumulated code or at least the most important parts to the Guile based system?

4. When the newer features like FFI, dynamic modules, become more popular and people start to push Emacs further and further in its role as an editor and other things besides will they become frustrated with Emacs lisp limitations sooner rather later, and feel they would have better up developing around Guile or some other LISP alternative?

When it comes to being an editor, it is those with a good knowledge of emacs internals who can judge these issues. They could argue that with all the new features arriving in Emacs it will be an interesting and exciting place for a long time, ie good enough to see most of the current users to retirement or to meet their forseeable needs for the near future. Or, they could argue that the pain points will arrive sooner rather than later, and thus it would be a good idea for others to start piling into Guile Emacs or some other alternative whilst they (emacs-devel) focus their efforts on taking the current system as far as it can.


I get the impression that there is a desire to create a new LISP development experience,  something akin to Pharo for Smalltalk, Eclipse and Netbeans for Java, or Lazarus for ObjectPascal and that despite a lot of Lisp work being done with Emacs,  the Guile VM by means of porting Emacs to it is considered to be a better path forward, a foundation for a future GNU or GPL'd Lisp IDE and ecosystem, which goes beyond simply being an editor.

Xah Lee raised some similar points on [RMS supports Language Server Protocol integration into Emacs core](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/696pv1/rms_supports_language_server_protocol_integration/dh4mhzi/)

My view is that it is better to develop a brand new Lisp based IDE, and use the knowledge gained from developing and using Emacs to build its editor especially if its editor is to be standalone editor as well. The benefit of developing Guile/Emacs is that it draws in a community and leads to greater exploration of ideas, techniques and concepts that will help that ideal along.

But folks should realize that /u/eli-zaretskii, /u/wasamasa, u/jwiegley et al  are **developers of an editor** and **their focus is on emacs as an editor**, not as a **gateway to THE 21st century Lisp experience**.

I think /u/wasamasa shouldn't get or sound so irate when the topic comes up again and again.

But I think in all these arguments the deeper underlying issue has been ignored. Which is that over the past 25 years most of the effort which should have gone into bringing the development environments like Smalltalk, LISP, Prolog (the opensource/free/libre variants) into the 21th centry etc has been channelled into dead-end Javascript. Java and browser-based/Javascript's UI frameworks (an entirely separate category with unending variations and iterations, eg [Atom](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6zomuq/atom_github_announces_atomide/)). The hacker itch has been channelled into those systems and as such the environments like LISP, Smaltalk etc which were seen as the most productive in the 90s, have lost their impetus and their personnel, and need some new blood to pick them up now that the now older developers are looking to move on to other things at that stage in their lives.

Those areas need to be re-explored and rebooted by a new generation, and help for that won't be coming from the Big 4 and Mozilla who are focused on developing around subsystems whose purpose is to keep consumer's eyes [glued to their phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHJzTtWBT7A).",79,67,"Guile needs a community, Elisp/Emacs needs a technology",emacs

"I try to keep my computer as secure as possible. One rule I try to stick to is to only use software from the repository of my distribution. I accepted some other package managers too though (gem, pip).

As I realized that emacs ships with it's own package manager, I happily started using it. It only a text editor, I may have thought.

But when I thought about it recently the package manager of emacs seemed to me like a huge security risk.

It:

* is provided with my sudo-enabled user-password (`sudo:`)

* is provided with the decryption passphrase to my PGP key

* can read all my data 


this is pretty much all you can wish for.

The packages that are allowed to operate in that environment are:

* not all transmitted through a SSL connection `http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/` (I had that in my `.emacs` they provide SSL connection now, maybe only my fault)

* are from a repository to that more or less everybody can upload

* …with conflicting and poor versioning

* not signed

* not trusted by a trustworthy party 

* not checked and audited by a trustworthy party

* have unlimited access to all of the privileges emacs enjoys (I know I ask for much here)


The points made here are only what I understand is the case. And I'm not sure I if really did.

Do I misunderstand or miss something?

I guess there are a lot of security concerned emacs users out there. What do you think, what do you do to make your emacs more secure? Is it a good idea to use the distribution provided packages from my linux distribution or would that be only window dressing since the would be as bad audited as the ones out in the wild?

Appreciate any thought and advices.

"Hello everyone,

TLDR: 
SyncOrg (aka MobileOrg 2.0) [on the play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coste.syncorg)

Real version:
I have finally release MobileOrg 2.0, now known as SyncOrg, on the play store. 

As you may know, MobileOrg was an org file parser. SyncOrg is a fork of this project with a more modern UI and a larger focus on file synchronization. With this first release that uses Git to synchronize files, you no longer need to use the application in conjunction with Emacs to synchronize. I plan to add at least DropBox synchronization and Google Drive in the future.

Thanks to redditers who gave me feedback last month, I have corrected a few bugs and the application should be more stable now.


Description of the app:
You create files, in which you creates notes and everything can be stored on your Git repo.
You toggle visibiility by touching the notes and you enter edit mode by swiping a note.

There are 2 read-only files: Agenda and TODO.

* Agenda is an agenda of all your timestamped notes.

* TODO is the list of all your todo items.




You can follow the project on my [GitHub](https://github.com/wizmer/syncorg) and open issues on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/wizmer/syncorg/issues).

PS: The reason for the change in name was that I had no answer from the previous maintainer to get access to his PlayStore account so I had to create mine and release under a different name.",25,70,MobileOrg 2.0 renamed to SyncOrg on PlayStore,emacs

"Since there seemed to be [interest](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3lt3c6/using_spacemacs_modeline_in_vanilla_emacs/) I went ahead and extracted the Spacemacs mode-line as an independent package. There's a [pull request](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/3164) open to use it in Spacemacs, so if it's not official enough for you yet, it will be soon.

It's installable from MELPA (unstable) as `spaceline`. The github repository is [here](https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline/tree/master). Detailed instructions are in the readme, but I might have missed something so don't hesitate to ask. It's pretty fresh so there could be bugs. I'm using it myself in Spacemacs with no issues, however. There's still a bit of work in Spacemacs that I chose not to port, so have a look at [this section of the README](https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline/tree/master#why-does-it-look-different) if results are not up to expectations.

This package is also a decently modular mode-line configuration library, so if you're up to it you can use it to build your own mode-lines, so long as you don't mind the general 'look and feel' of Spacemacs.

The DOOM modeline was designed for minimalism, and offers:

- A match count panel (for `anzu`, `iedit`, `multi-cusor`, `evil-search` and `evil-substitute`)
- An indicator for recording a macro
- Local `python`/`ruby`/`perl`/`go`/`elixir` version in the major-mode
- A customizable mode-line height (see `doom-modeline-height`)
- An error/warning count segment for `flycheck`
- A workspace number segment for `eyebrowse`
- A window number segment for `ace-window`, `winum` and `window-numbering`
- An indicator for `evil` state
- An indicator for current input method

"Another week, another trick. For this week, I will show you how I synchronize my `org` files with several devices, including my mobile phone and my laptop. You should know that I use `org-mode` for almost everything (*e.g.* appointments, project analysis, managing my contacts, personal organization, *etc.*) and one of the concerns I had was that I couldn't see my schedule with `org-agenda` when I was away. For instance, I like to use `org-agenda` to structure the trips I make, and it's convenient to be able to see it at a glance with your phone.

The issue of synchronizing `org` files often arises and it is true that it can be annoying to wait to be in front of your computer to see, add, edit and delete one or more tasks belonging to your `org` files, because we might forget to do so. Fortunately for us, this frustration will no longer exist after this post 😊

To achieve that, here are the two tools I use:

1. [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/): free and open-source service that allows you to synchronize your files with multiple devices.
2. [orgzly](https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android): Android application to manage notes and TODO lists provided by `org` files.

Let's take a closer look at these tools:

1. `syncthing`

It is good to know that I have been synchronizing my `org` files with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2) for a few years. The advantage of `dropbox` and `google-drive`, is that my data are on a cloud service and available when I wanted it. However, `dropbox` is not open-source and I like using open-source applications, that's why I use `syncthing`.

[Overview of syncthing](https://i.redd.it/y8wti8x984h11.png)

In the picture above, we see that I have two folders:

* Agenda: which is used to synchronize the `org` files of my `org-agenda`.
* Phone: which is used to synchronize the files on my phone (*e.g.* backups, music, pictures, *etc.*) with my laptop.

It is important to note that with `syncthing`, your data is not centralized, this implies that your data synchronizes when your devices simultaneously connected with an Internet connection, are registered in your management space to be able to synchronize. This can be a disadvantage if you want to synchronize at any time. Personally, I synchronize my files when I'm at home and I don't need to do that right now.

Finally, here is the command I use with `i3`/`sway` to automatically run `syncthing` when starting my windows manager:

    exec --no-startup-id syncthing -no-browser

**Summary:** if you do not care that your data are stored on a proprietary cloud, then `dropbox` (or `google-drive`) is the best solution since your data will be accessible at any time. If like me, you care about your data, fan of open-source and does not need to synchronize at any time, then `syncthing` will be your best choice.

2.  `orgzly`

This application is just awesome which is regularly updated, I thank every day the contributors for their exceptional work.

However, I must confess that I couldn't yet managed to allow automatic synchronization from my phone to my laptop and it can be frustrating to always do manual synchronization.

[Overview of orgzly](https://i.redd.it/i7wueryb44h11.png)

The picture above gives you a quick overview of the representation of your tasks with `orgzly`. What makes this application great is that you can change a lot of preferences, which will be specific to your personality 😊

**NOTE:** for iOS users, you can use [beorg](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beorg/id1238649962) or [MobileOrg](https://github.com/MobileOrg/mobileorg).

That's all for this week, I hope it will improve your daily organization. Feel free in the comments to share your tips regarding your `org` file synchronization (*e.g.* structure set up, useful features, *etc.*) 🐈

For the curious, you can find my config on [GitHub](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d).

"Another week, another trick. For this week, I wanted to highlight some packages, often put in the shade and that I daily use. As you noticed in the title, this post marks the first of a series of other posts in this style. I hope you will enjoy it 😊

Let's get started!

1. [wiki-summary](https://github.com/jozefg/wiki-summary.el)

How many times a day do you have to do a search to find the definition of a specific term? Pretty boring, I'll give you that. That's why, `wiki-summary` is here to help you. It allows you to get the Wikipedia summary for a term and display the result in a buffer.

[Preview of wiki-summary.](https://i.redd.it/388063k7oae11.png)

Its configuration can be done as below:

    (use-package wiki-summary
      :defer 1
      :bind (""C-c W"" . wiki-summary))

**NOTE:** the default I reapproach to this package is that I have to `switch-window` (`C-x o`), do a `kill-buffer` (`C-x k`) and `delete-other-windows` (`C-x 1`) every time I look for a term. So, I must admit that I would have preferred the focus to be directly done on the buffer that contains the summary after a search and that I could simply leave it with the `q` key. If you have an idea how to do that, I am a taker, knowing that I doubt that this package will still suffer contributions since the last contribution dates back more than 3 years 🐈

**UPDATE:** a big thank you to [oantolin](https://www.reddit.com/user/oantolin) for his solution. This is the updated configuration:

    (use-package wiki-summary
      :defer 1
      :bind (""C-c W"" . wiki-summary)
      :preface
      (defun my/format-summary-in-buffer (summary)
        ""Given a summary, stick it in the *wiki-summary* buffer and display the buffer""
        (let ((buf (generate-new-buffer ""*wiki-summary*"")))
          (with-current-buffer buf
            (princ summary buf)
            (fill-paragraph)
            (goto-char (point-min))
            (text-mode)
            (view-mode))
          (pop-to-buffer buf))))
    
    (advice-add 'wiki-summary/format-summary-in-buffer :override #'my/format-summary-in-buffer) 

2. [which-key](https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key)

Some people tell me that GNU Emacs is too complicated to use with all those crazy keyboard shortcuts. I often laugh whenI hear that, because I don't know either all the keys and that's why I use `which-key`. On the basis of the executed of a series of key, it will displays you available keybindings in popup after a certain delay. Even the octopus (often representative of GNU Emacs users) sometimes needs a reminder 😊

[Overview of which-key.](https://i.redd.it/2jeiwxjkrae11.png)

**NOTE:** I used [guide-key](https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key) in my past days, but there's no reason to use it anymore with `which-key`.

Here's how to configure this package:

    (use-package which-key
      :defer 0.2
      :diminish
      :config (which-key-mode))

3. [paradox](https://github.com/Malabarba/paradox)

This package is great,  it gives you a lot of information about packages in the mode-line. Moreover, it integrates well with `package-list-packages`. We couldn't ask for anything better 😊

[Overview of paradox.](https://i.redd.it/zmekfqfdtae11.png)

This is how to get the same configuration displayed in the image above:

    (use-package paradox
      :defer 1
      :custom
      (paradox-column-width-package 27)
      (paradox-column-width-version 13)
      (paradox-execute-asynchronously t)
      (paradox-hide-wiki-packages t)
      :config
      (paradox-enable)
      (remove-hook 'paradox-after-execute-functions #'paradox--report-buffer-print))

**NOTE:** my only frustration is still having to wait every time few seconds for the packets to synchronize when executing the `package-list-packages` command. I would have liked that `package-refresh-contents` runs only once when starting GNU Emacs, using a separate thread to automatically load the packages. This must be possible with [emacs-async](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async), but if you already have this kind of system in place, I'd be interested to know more 😊

That's all for this week! I hope these packages will help you as long as they help me.

"Another week, another trick. This week, I will present you one of my favorite modes, `hydra`. Probably most of you already know this mode, but I know that some have never taken the time to get interested, and for me, `hydra` is more than a necessity to be productive. `hydra` can be roughly described as a menu generator in which each menu has a function and a binding. What better way to present the beast than with an illustration!

Sexy isnt it? With a simple keyboard shortcut, I can display this menu and choose a function among a letter. You're gonna tell me okay, that's great, but why is it a necessity? Well, let's say we don't use all the functions of GNU Emacs, and humanly speaking, it's normal \*laughter\*. We often use the same functions and from time to time discover a new function. `hydra` allows you to group the functions you intend to use in your workflow.

About my workflow, I use `hydra` for a lot of things, like managing:

* buffers \(`C-c b`\) ;
* erc \(`C-c e`\) ;
* flycheck \(`C-c f`\) ;

**NOTE:**  it is important to choose keyboard shortcuts that are easy to remember.

Plus, what's great about `hydra` is that it's easy to configure! The menu above can be programmed in this way:

    (use-package hydra
      :defer 2
      :bind (""C-c c"" . hydra-clock/body))
    
    (defhydra hydra-clock (:color blue)
        ""
        ^
        ^Clock^             ^Do^
        ^─────^─────────────^──^─────────

        ^^                  _e_ effort
        ^^                  _i_ in
        ^^                  _j_ jump
        ^^                  _o_ out
        ^^                  _r_ report
        ^^                  ^^
        ""
        (""q"" nil)
        (""c"" org-clock-cancel :color pink)
        (""d"" org-clock-display)
        (""e"" org-clock-modify-effort-estimate)
        (""i"" org-clock-in)
        (""j"" org-clock-goto)
        (""o"" org-clock-out)
        (""r"" org-clock-report))

**NOTE:** I tend to use blue as the default primary color for letters, so I can use red color to highlight some more delicate function.

**UPDATE:**  thanks to [github\-alphapapa](https://www.reddit.com/user/github-alphapapa) for letting me know in the comments, that colors are mainly used for their behavior, before the aesthetic side.

In conclusion, `hydra` gives me the possibility to easily use functions I'm used to and not, with keyboard shortcuts that are easy to remember.

To finish this post, I want to thank Mathieu Marques \([angrybacon](https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs)\) which I was inspired from his configuration for certain functions that I use every day.

For the curious, you can find my config on [GitHub](https://github.com/rememberyou/.emacs.d).

"Here is the changelog

* mark-and-expand: new state when point is inside an html element ; a selection of the inner content is done before selecting the element.
* mark-and-expand: preserve original vertical window offset
* blade: compatibility with new blocks: {!! $x !!}
* dust: better indentation for multiline blocks
* django: improved distinction between keywords and control blocks (tags)
* jinja: compatibility with {% trans %} {% endtrans %}, and {% for %} {% else %} {% endfor %} blocks (undefined in django)
* mason: better fontification
* erb: more accurate detection of control blocks
* javascript: better lexing to avoid ambiguation between the / operator, /(a|b)/ regexp and comments (// and /* */)
* unicode: better care of multibyte characters (thx kissge)
* indentation: deal with javascript decorator syntax
* web-mode-enable-sql-detection must be set to t to enable sql fontification and indentation in strings
* fontification: improved compatibility with minor modes relying on font-locking (e.g. whitespace-mode)
* fontification: new face web-mode-filter-face (e.g. “length” in {{ mylist|length }})
* fontification: if web-mode-enable-part-face is t you can customize web-mode-script|style-face which inheritate from web-mode-part-face ; it can be used to set the default foreground/background of the part
* minor mode: basic compatibility with hide show mode
* indentation: customize string concat indentation with lineup-quotes
* other: compatibility with universal-argument ( C-u ) for web-mode-element-clone|kill|next|previous|vanish, web-mode-attribute-kill|next|previous

The next months will be dedicated to reactjs and jsx. 
I'll have to introduce the notion of element-depth to deal with the recursive side of this language. 
e.g.

    return (
        <ul>
            {
                this.props.list.map(function(element) {
                    return <li>{element}</li>;
                })
            }
        </ul>
    )

With this notion of depth, perhaps I'll be able to provide indentation of html code inside block strings (php heredocs for example)

"Hey all,

I graduated from college in December, and started working as a software engineer in January. I primarily work with Java, JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

When people find out I use Emacs, there's usually some teasing involved–""You use Emacs? *Why?*"" I usually take these opportunities to explain how Emacs is more than just a simple text editor, and explain some of what my configuration helps me do. At this point, people usually drop the topic.

My question is–do you all find that Emacs (and Emacs alone) does what you need it to do for your day-to-day work? Or do you find yourselves using IDEs regularly, for the fancy features?

"You're undoubtedly aware of the [Magit kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681258897/its-magit-the-magical-git-client) and the amazing job that Jonas has done over the past several years in maintaining and enhancing this package, which has proven itself so incredibly valuable to so many of us.

What you (like me) probably weren't aware of was just [how much he was sacrificing](https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/3174#issuecomment-330091971) in order to do that.

Funding the kickstarter to its goal amount allows Jonas to keep improving the software, and the greatest benefit of that is really to Magit's users, who will be getting an even better version of the software they love.  Reaching the goal amount makes things better for **us**.

What we now have is the opportunity to give something back -- to make this about more than just improving the software in the future, and to say thank you to Jonas for the years of dedication and effort that got Magit to this point in the first place.

Anyone who has paid any attention to the development of Magit will have an appreciation for the quality of Jonas' work, and I think it's a safe bet that he could have packed this in a long time ago in favour of a decent salary and a significantly-improved standard of living.

The fact that he didn't has resulted in the Magit we have today.

Perhaps we can do something a little bit life-changing in return.

"I'd been using ido for some time, but was unaware of `ido-restrict-to-matches` (`C-SPC` or `C-@`), which is quite useful.  Just in case someone else is in the same position, I thought I'd point it out; it lets you provide multiple substrings from the results that you want.

`ido` supports substring matching.  So, for example, let's say that you are trying to open a particular .c file in a directory.  You hit `C-x C-f` to run `ido-find-file`.  You think that there's only a single .c file in that directory, so you type "".c"", expecting only a single option to have that string in its name and come up.  To your surprise, there's both a foo-internals.c and a foo-externals.c file.

Well, if you deleted the "".c"" bit, and started typing ""externals.c"", that'd get you the file in question.  But that seems wasteful; you've already filtered the possible files down to just two.

You can simply hit `C-SPC` or `C-@` to save your existing set of matches, then plug in more criteria.  So `C-x C-f .c C-SPC ex RET` would get you the file that you want.

This is probably old hat to serious ido users, but I'd been completely oblivious to it, and certainly wanted it.",21,65,"If you use ido, make sure that you know about ido-restrict-to-matches",emacs

"I've been working in emacs for over two-weeks now, doing full time development in Clojure. Prior to that, I've been using emacs for 6 month, mostly spending my time in org-mode.  For the most part, I feel I am productive and sufficiently competent to keep on using it as my main source code editor (credit goes to smartparens and good repl integrations). However, all is not perfect.  I'm constantly fighting emacs's window and buffer placement.  Why is it that managing my workspace is so hard in Emacs?
How does one go about organizing windows, one for code, one for help/docs, one for repls, shells, etc, enforce window size to prevent unexpected resizes to wreck layouts.  

To me, if feels like emacs isn't built to make good use of todays large screen areas.  The default behaviors make sense when I work in a small frame, but are inadequate when in full screen mode. I am willing to wager that window management is one of these issues that many new emacs users face and give up on, preferring the other IDEs or editors with less surprising window behaviors. 

I am really curious: how do you, the software engineer with the large monitor using emacs all day to write your code, do it?  How do manage your emacs windows efficiently?

* Option `magit-todos-exclude-globs`, a list of glob patterns to ignore when searching for to-do items.  Can be used to ignore directories and/or files (e.g. in dir-local variables).
* Running scans are killed when the Magit status buffer is closed. (I'd like more testing on this feature, but I haven't heard any complaints yet, so I guess it's all right.)

----

GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole,
is an amazing, programmable hypertextual information management
system implemented as a GNU Emacs package and extensively
documented.  Hyperbole has been greatly expanded and updated for
use with the latest Emacs 26 releases; it supports GNU Emacs 24.4
or above.

Hyperbole can boost your day-to-day productivity with Emacs and
your ability to manage information stored across many different
machines on the internet.  People who get used to Hyperbole often
find they prefer never to use Emacs without it.

Hyperbole includes its own easy-to-use hypertextual buttons and
links that can be created without the need for any markup language.

It also comes out-of-the-box with:

  - a hierarchical, record-based contact manager

  - a rapid window and frame control system

  - a powerful multi-level auto-numbered outliner

  - and two very smart context-dependent mouse and keyboard keys
    that simplify operations in many editing and browsing modes.
    All features are aimed at making textual information management
    and display fast and easy.

Bob Weiner designed and programmed GNU Hyperbole.  He and Mats
Lidell maintain it with the Free Software Foundation.  It includes
an interactive demo to introduce you to its features as well as a
detailed reference manual, as explained here:

  https://www.gnu.org/s/hyperbole/hyperbole.html#invocation-and-doc

----

Please give Hyperbole a try.  It's free, man.  It adapts to your
needs. It connects everything.  It rewires your brain.  It speeds
your web searches for `carpal tunnel syndrome'.  It makes you feel
like the sun is out on a gray winter day :-)

But wait, there's more and this part is serious.  For a limited
time, to encourage use and feedback, the first 30 people who try
out the Hyperbole DEMO or read the Hyperbole Manual and send a few
thoughtful sentences to <rsw at gnu dot org> will receive either of
their choice of the following as yet unpublished single file Emacs
Lisp libraries:

    ;;  rsw-linecol.el: User-editable mode-line col/line number formats
    ;;
    ;;  GNU Emacs buries the formatting of mode-line line and column
    ;;  numbers in a way that makes it virtually impossible for a user
    ;;  to change this formatting.  This library fixes that with a new
    ;;  variable which may be modified to instantly alter the mode-line
    ;;  column and line number display.

or

    ;;  rsw-chrome-macos.el: Open a URL in Google Chrome and reuse an
    ;;     existing tab/window if already displayed.
    ;;
    ;;  This library resolves the many problems of sending URLs to
    ;;  Google Chrome on MacOS.  It properly sends # hash in-file links
    ;;  (these are typically stripped when Chrome is called as a MacOS
    ;;  application).  It reuses any tab already displaying any
    ;;  matching URL that is sent and it does this even if the
    ;;  ultimately displayed URL goes through several redirects before
    ;;  display.

I became disappointed soon enough because it didn't match-up to Microsoft VS, but then... I eventually returned...


During the initial happy-phase I'd went through the tutorial and set up extensive coding libraries that embiggened my 'macs into an ide (one with actually more features than most others).


Fast forward to the future, I was looking for an alternative to code::blocks. 

It felt like crap and I decided that even nano would be more fucking fun.

I googled a bit and found several mentions of emacs.

I decided to check up on the ol' thing.

I fire up the ol' M-x (beefed up with I-search right in the minibuffer ofc)
and install a mild-dark theme (i.e. darkmine) for some cozy goodness.

I tinky-winker around and I rediscover the ide plugins: function-args, helm-projectile, ggtags, magit.

They work like chopped butter and they glide like moonlight.

I sit back and stare.

And I think, ""if emacs is so powerful, then surely there's a plugin to emulate a typewriter""

(i.e. no deletion, backspace, cut/kill. Only forward)

I find the draft-mode plugin. It forces me to write haiku.

I can't stop. It won't let me.

I keybind a ""focus-mode"" that goes into full-screen draft-mode.
I keybind my 'macs through xfce for quick access.

I stare in awe. I transcend.

"In Emacs, ""lossage"" is a log of the buttons you've pressed. This is useful for, say ""what did I just do to make that happen?"" or ""what was the command I ran?"" It previously was a stream of letters like this:

I recently built a new version of Emacs from the git repo, and now that same list is represented like this:

"Another week, another trick. For this week, we will take a look at how to use `git` with GNU Emacs. As it is quite common to work on Git repositories, it is important to have a decent configuration for our daily lives 😊

Of course, to start this post I have to talk about [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit), which is probably one of the star packages of GNU Emacs. If you do not know this package, I highly recommend you to be interested in it, it will greatly facilitate your daily life. Personally, I have no particular configuration with and I'm curious to know yours.

    (use-package magit :defer 0.3)

**NOTE:** I will probably make another tip only on `magit` once I have taken the time to get more interested on it 😊

However, this is the simple `hydra` menu that I use with this one:

[Overview of hydra](https://i.redd.it/6gel8tr1jpf11.png)

And naturally, with its configuration:

    (use-package hydra
        :defer 1
        :bind (""C-c m"" . hydra-magit/body))
    
    (defhydra hydra-magit (:color blue)
      ""

      ^^                  _i_ init
      ^^                  _s_ status
      ^^                  ^^
      ""
      (""q"" nil)
      (""b"" magit-blame)
      (""c"" magit-clone)
      (""i"" magit-init)
      (""s"" magit-status))

One of the things you might appreciate is seeing the lines that are modified in the file while it is being edited. This can be simply done with [git-gutter](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-git-gutter), as shown below:

[Overview of git-gutter](https://i.redd.it/lhppgyb5jpf11.png)

Notice that the indicator with the green `+` appears because `git-gutter` notices that we have added new lines. This works as well if you delete lines 😊

Its configuration is relatively simple:

    (use-package git-gutter
      :defer 0.3
      :diminish
      :init (global-git-gutter-mode +1))

**NOTE :** if you want, you can change the symbols and colors as you like. I invite you to read the documentation to do so.

A good practice that I have tried to stick to for the past few years, is [to not exceed 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for the summary of my commits.  In the same way, I try that the body of my commits respects the convention of 72 characters. Nothing could be easier with `git-commit`.

[Overview of git-commit](https://i.redd.it/u5gzdw33jpf11.png)

You can see that when I exceed the recommended size for the summary of the commit, the color of the letters changes to yellow.  Similarly for the body, when it exceeds 72 characters, there is automatically a line break. Great! 😊

This can be configured with the lines below:

    (use-package git-commit
      :after magit
      :hook (git-commit-mode . my/git-commit-auto-fill-everywhere)
      :custom (git-commit-summary-max-length 50)
      :preface
      (defun my/git-commit-auto-fill-everywhere ()
        ""Ensures that the commit body does not exceed 72 characters.""
        (setq fill-column 72)
        (setq-local comment-auto-fill-only-comments nil)))

Finally, another package that I rarely use, but that can be useful in some cases, is to view the changes made in previous commits. This can be done with [git-timemachine](https://github.com/emacsmirror/git-timemachine). I refer you to the documentation if you want to have an overview of how it works.

Its configuration is simplistic:

    (use-package git-timemachine :defer 1 :diminish)

"Another week, another trick. This week, a longer post, but I thought it would be interesting to share with you my way of using `org-journal`. First of all, many people use `org-mode` to be organized by planning their tasks, which is a good thing in itself. The concern is that it lacks an analysis phase and this phase of analysis is done with `org-journal` that allows you to make a report of your day and become aware of good or bad habits.

In this post I will give you some explanations about the organization of my files and give to you some configurations to simplify your life with `org-journal` as well as explain how to encrypt your data which is important as we will see why later.

Anyway, let's get started!

To explain how my files are organized, I share all my files in a cloud, which is convenient for me to access them with multiple devices. To do this, I name these files by the current date and place them in a folder that corresponds to the year.

**NOTE:** I use [Synthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) because I tend to avoid proprietary software, even more when it comes to storing my data.

Let's take a look at how I do this with Emacs:

      (use-package org-journal
        :bind ((""C-c t"" . journal-file-today)
               (""C-c y"" . journal-file-yesterday))
        :custom
        (org-journal-dir ""~/Sync/shared/.journal/2018/"")
        (org-journal-file-format ""%Y%m%d"")
        (org-journal-date-format ""%e %b %Y (%A)"")
        (org-journal-time-format """")
        :preface
        (defun get-journal-file-today ()
          ""Gets filename for today's journal entry.""
          (let ((daily-name (format-time-string ""%Y%m%d"")))
            (expand-file-name (concat org-journal-dir daily-name))))
    
        (defun journal-file-today ()
          ""Creates and load a journal file based on today's date.""
          (interactive)
          (find-file (get-journal-file-today)))
    
        (defun get-journal-file-yesterday ()
          ""Gets filename for yesterday's journal entry.""
          (let* ((yesterday (time-subtract (current-time) (days-to-time 1)))
                 (daily-name (format-time-string ""%Y%m%d"" yesterday)))
            (expand-file-name (concat org-journal-dir daily-name))))
    
        (defun journal-file-yesterday ()
          ""Creates and load a file based on yesterday's date.""
          (interactive)
          (find-file (get-journal-file-yesterday)))

**UPDATE:** there is no need to use the `journal-file-today` and `get-journal-file-today` functions, as underline it *bastibe* in comments. The built\-in `org-journal-new-entry` function, does it as well.

These ideas come from Howard Abrams, you can find them on [his](http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/journaling-org.html) blog for more information. With them, it will allow you to use the  `C-c t`  \(resp. `C-c y`\) keyboard shortcut to automatically create a file if it does not already exist and to indicate your observations for the day \(resp. yesterday\). Don't forget to change the path indicated with yours and possibly modify these keyboard shortcuts by those that correspond to you. For those who are not yet comfortable with [use\-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), I invite you to look at the documentation.

**NOTE:** an improvement idea is to give a path to `org-journal-dir` and create/call a function that returns the current year. This will avoid manually changing the path in `org-journal-dir` for next years.

Now all that remains is to encrypt these files with `org-crypt` to allow better security. To do this, first add `org-crypt` in the org modules that need to be loaded:

      (setq org-modules '(...
                          org-crypt
                          ...))
      '(org-load-modules-maybe t)

Now we can configure `org-crypt`:

      (use-package org
        :bind (""C-c d"" . org-decrypt-entry)
        :init (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
        :custom
        (org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote (""crypt"")))
        (org-crypt-key ""E9AADC36E94A672D1A07D49B208FCDBB98190562"")
        (auto-save-default nil))

I pass you the explanation of each function and variable, the only variable that interests us is `org-crypt-key` that allows you to enter the ID of your key to allow asymmetric encryption \(replace with `nil` if you want symmetric encryption\). Of course, if you use asymmetric encryption, don't forget to generate a key pair with your operating system \(which I don't explain here\).

Also remember to add `crypt` tag in the list of org tags:

      (setq org-tag-alist '(...
                            (""crypt"" . ?C)
                            ...)))

Now, each time you save a text in `org-mode` by specifying the `crypt` tag, it will be encrypted! Isn't that cool?

And this is what it looks like:

[Before encryption](https://i.redd.it/0f7zkuae26z01.png)

[After encryption](https://i.redd.it/0g41hqcg26z01.png)

"Another week, another trick. This week, I will present you the way I handle my emails. This management is not exceptional, but it may give ideas to some of you.

First of all, you should know that I started GNU Emacs using `gnus`, that I used many years for these possibilities especially to read different feeds. Nevertheless, I stopped using it for `notmuch`. This package is perfect for you, if you want to store all your emails and easily search them, much like a database. However, I did not want to keep the various spam, and removing them was not feasible. Finally, as you suspected by the title, I went to `mu4e` that I fell in love!

[Overview of the main interface of mu4e](https://i.redd.it/mnd7zpnd7c311.png)

**UPDATE:** `notmuch` also allows to delete emails using a Bash script (see comment), thanks to [holgerschurig](https://www.reddit.com/user/holgerschurig).

For me, `mu4e` is great! This allows me to read my emails with a nice interface, gives me the ability to easily search for an email, write an email, etc. Of course, it doesn't just do that! What I like about it, is its simple configuration, and how I can write my emails in `org-mode`, who doesn't like `org-mode`?

Without going into details, here is what my `mu4e` configuration looks like:

    (use-package mu4e
      :ensure nil
      :ensure-system-package mu
      :custom
      (mu4e-attachment-dir ""~/Downloads"")
      (mu4e-compose-signature-auto-include nil)
      (mu4e-drafts-folder ""/gmail/Drafts"")
      (mu4e-get-mail-command ""mbsync -a"")
      (mu4e-maildir ""~/Maildir"")
      (mu4e-refile-folder ""/gmail/Archive"")
      (mu4e-sent-folder ""/gmail/Sent Mail"")
      (mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
       '((""/gmail/INBOX"" . ?i)
         (""/gmail/All Mail"" . ?a)
         (""/gmail/Deleted Items"" . ?d)
         (""/gmail/Drafts"" . ?D)
         (""/gmail/Important"" . ?i)
         (""/gmail/Sent Mail"" . ?s)
         (""/gmail/Starred"" . ?S)))
      (mu4e-trash-folder ""/gmail/Trash"")
      (mu4e-update-interval 300)
      (mu4e-use-fancy-chars t)
      (mu4e-view-show-addresses t)
      (mu4e-view-show-images t))

**NOTE:** I use a Gmail address, but adapt this configuration for your email service.

Complementary with `mu4e`, I use `mbsync` to be capable of synchronizing mail on IMAP server with local `Maildir` folder. I'm used to using `offlineimap`, but I find it slower than `mbsync`, that's why I separated myself from it. Overall, here is what your `~/.mbsyncrc` file should look like:

    IMAPAccount gmail
    Host imap.gmail.com
    User terencio.agozzino
    PassCmd ""gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/Sync/shared/.mbsyncpass.gpg""
    Port 993
    SSLType IMAPS
    AuthMechs Login
    CertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    
    IMAPStore gmail-remote
    Account gmail
    
    MaildirStore gmail-local
    Path ~/Maildir/gmail/
    Inbox ~/Maildir/gmail/INBOX
    
    Channel gmail
    Master :gmail-remote:
    Slave :gmail-local:
    Patterns ""INBOX"" ""All Mail"" ""Deleted Items"" ""Drafts"" ""Important"" ""Sent Mail"" ""Starred""
    Create Slave
    Sync All
    Expunge Both
    SyncState *

To have more details about my configuration, I invite you to go in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rememberYou/dotfiles).

Finally, I use `mu4e-alert` to receive a notification each time I receive emails:

    (use-package mu4e-alert
        :after mu4e
        :hook ((after-init . mu4e-alert-enable-mode-line-display)
               (after-init . mu4e-alert-enable-notifications))
        :config (mu4e-alert-set-default-style 'libnotify))

I still don't have very far in my `mu4e` configuration, but this will allow you to have a good base with this one. Besides, several `mu4e` packages exist, that's why don't hesitate to comment on some of these packages you use.

For the curious, you can find my config on [GitHub](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d).

Emacs sort of has a problem of letting one buffer have more than 1 major mode.  In fact, by default you can't do this.  As a web developer this was initially really frustrating for me (until I found web-mode.  There's nothing better in my opinion).  Anyway,  I've been using org-mode for quite some time, and it gets old to have to type ""C-c '"" all the time when I want to edit a source code block.  Well polymode, lets an org-mode file have several active major modes at once.  So I can now use paredit in an org-mode file in an elisp snippet, without having to type ""C-c '"" first!

It is really similar to mmm-mode, but is a little younger and has some differences.  ",13,57,Polymode is awesome,emacs

"### Alternate Title:  New vs. Old:  the interface issue that just won't go away.


I'm an old-hand at using emacs now, with over 20 years of heavy use.  And I'm getting very weary of posts here that have the following form:


""I really want to learn emacs...now, how can I make emacs behave exactly like an interface I'm already familiar with?""


Typically, this is a  vi(m) user or Windows user, perplexed and/or horrified that emacs does something differently from the beloved default behavior of $OTHER_INTERFACE.    And yes, ""beloved"" is a bit of snark, as ""expected"" (or ""unquestioned"", or ""unconsidered"") would be more accurate.


And inevitably, someone will say ""it's nice when things are the same"" (or almost equally often whine, ""why can't things be the same?!"")


And that's sort of the core issue here:  is same-ness the greatest virtue possible in interface design?   


I'll grant that consistency is helpful.  But it's more important *within* interfaces than between them.  My phone, my television, my editor, my OS, and my video games all have different interfaces, and I seem to be mentally flexible enough to roll with that.  (And many of these have multiple interfaces embedded within them...though I'll also freely concede that many of these interfaces are just plain awful.)


But emacs has an *excellent* interface...if you are willing to learn it.


Though, **it is different**.  Emacs and GNU Readline have a different heritage than CUA and vi.


**It is also niche**.  CUA users, in particular, worldwide simply dwarf emacs/readline users.  (Heck, I'm a CUA-user myself, in many contexts!  ...but this is also some of my frustration here:  I don't feel that I have some special genius brain wiring that makes me one of the lucky gifted few who can master more than *one* interface.)  So, approaching the title question again:  should emacs assimilate?


As an old-hand who has (at least to some degree) mastered emacs interface I want to scream, ""NO!""   The emacs native interface is a highly-developed interface, with over 3 decades of refinements.  And while some of emacs defaults were (and are) arbitrary choices, some are very carefully and conscientiously chosen for both gross and subtle reasons.   And I see very little harm in emacs *being* different.  Again, life is full of wildly different interfaces, and human brains are more than capable of handling those differences.


But inevitably, someone will object ""what about attracting new users?""


Putting aside the question of whether the emacs community needs to grow...


which is itself very arguable question; so arguable, in fact, I'll ask you to make your own reddit post, if you wish to debate it!  (Seriously, please consider this question off-topic, here!  Make a new post if you feel it needs discussing!)


...when a new potential emacs user asks how to make emacs mimic a more familiar interface, the current community's general response is to humor them, and provide the means to do so.


Part of this is that emacs is so flexible, it can!  Part of this, is that explaining the pros and cons of changing the interface is complicated (and likely overwhelming for a new user).  And part of this is just a desire to be helpful (and potentially help the emacs user-base to grow).


But I'm not convinced this is the best policy.  Especially since the result is usually a terrible hybrid of not-quite-emacs, not-quite newbie-familiar interface.  The worst of both worlds!   Doubly so for a beginner, just trying to learn emacs.  And we've created additional obstacles to them ever learning the native interface:  we've eliminated some of the motivation to do so by coddling their existing habits, and we've perhaps mangled the defaults to the point where tutorials or other forms of help are now potentially invalid and misleading.   And both of these reinforce the (wildly inccorect) idea that emacs native interface is awful, outdated and worthless.


I tend to think a better approach would be to just ask them to accept that *emacs is different, in a good way*, and try to convince them to learn some new habits, as a part of ""learning emacs"".   Rather than to pervert emacs native interface into some bastard hybrid.   


And for clarity, this is for **new** users only...once you're familiar with emacs, if you want to make *well-considered changes* to anything, to improve your experience, I'm all for that, and all for the community helping you out (if you need it).  But I think new users desires for change come from a bad place, namely:  ignorance and laziness (""I don't understand this interface, and I'm not willing to give it a fair try."")  Instead of a more experienced, ""I've tried things both ways, and coming from that experience, I prefer things this way.""


But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe emacs native interface is outdated and harmful.   Maybe all interfaces would benefit from uniformity, until customized.  Perhaps CUA is the one true way, and all text-based interfaces should strive to conform as closely as possible to that model.


So I'm asking the community:  should emacs be different?  ",148,59,Should emacs be different?,emacs

"Hello guys !

I am super happy to announce that I have dropped my first APK release on Github.
It is the first iteration of what I called MobileOrg 2.0, an Android Org Mode parser with a Git synchronization. (For the time being I have disabled all other sync mechanism as I want to debug the Git sync but they will be re-enabled in the future)


Besides the fact it uses Git, the major change is the fact than MobileOrg is now standalone. It means you no longer have to interact and use weird commands such as M-x org-mobile-push to synchronize. This implies that the app has to create the agenda file by its own (I am aware the agenda is not functional for the time being).


Quick Start:

- Go [here](https://github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/releases/tag/2.0.2) and download the APK

- Put the APK on your phone and click it to install it (you'll have to allow unsigned APK to continue)

- When you'll launch the app for the first time you'll be asked Git credentials. Here are a 2 examples of how to fill the stuff.

* Sync with a github repo (let's take mine at https://github.com/wizmer/OrgNotes) 
As MobileOrg does not support (yet) https, you'll have to use SSH+private key authentication. In username set: **git** (not your username !!), select your private key, in absolute path set: wizmer/OrgNotes**.git** (don't forget the .git !) and in host: github.com, you can let port blank as port 22 is default.

* Now to sync with you own repo on your own server.
Filling the form is straightforward. Just make sure to use the **absolute** path (EDIT: you can also use the form '~/relativePath'). But the caveat is that your repository must be in **bare** mode. Here is a procedure to create a bare repo with the org file you want to synchronize.

Edit: I have updated the APK to correct the crash on Android Nougat



1. Go on your server

2. Create the bare repo: mkdir bareRepo && cd bareRepo && git init --bare

3. Clone it: cd .. && git clone bareRepo nonBare

4. you will use the nonBare to commit and push your first files: cp *.org nonBare/ && cd nonBare && git add *.org && git commit -m ""adding my files"" && git push

5. you can now delete the nonBare repo: cd .. && rm -rf nonBare

6. back to MobileOrg and specify the absolute path to the bare repo


Enjoy !

    Type M-s C-e to yank rest of line onto end of search string and search for it.
    Type C-y to yank the last string of killed text.
    Type M-y to replace string just yanked into search prompt

    Type C-q to quote control character to search for it.
    Type C-x 8 RET to add a character to search by Unicode name, with completion.
    C-g while searching or when search has failed cancels input back to what has
     been found successfully.
    C-g when search is successful aborts and moves point to starting point.
    If you try to exit with the search string still empty, it invokes
     nonincremental search.

    Type M-s c to toggle search case-sensitivity.
    Type M-s i to toggle search in invisible text.
    Type M-s r to toggle regular-expression mode.
    Type M-s w to toggle word mode.
    Type M-s _ to toggle symbol mode.

C-M-w is great. Deletes the last character without having to reach for delete key.
M-s e is what I was hoping for. It allows editing the minibuffer with all the shortcuts active as you would expect when editing a text (including navigation)

"Thanks to [eli-zaretskii](/user/eli-zaretskii) I have the answer:

Assign the ""primary"" font on the `default` face, via `(set-face-font 'default ""Input Mono-14"")`

Assign font overrides to `fontset-default` via `set-fontset-font` for everything else, via things like `(set-fontset-font t 'phaistos-disc ""Preferred Font For Script-14"")`, or `(set-fontset-font ""fontset-default"" (#x1234 . #x4321) ...)`; see the documentation for [`set-fontset-font`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Fontsets.html#index-set_002dfontset_002dfont-4654) for details of the valid arguments to specify the font, and the target range(s), in that call.

...and don't touch the underlying details, especially creating fontsets, because I had incorrectly wandered into the ""you are not expected to understand this"" part of the typeface management code, and I definitely didn't really understand it. :)

---------------
## Original post

Today, frustrated at a less readable, and poorly sized, font being used for some characters outside of ASCII, I thought to myself ""I'll configure Emacs to use a better font there, with an appropriate size, so this code doesn't look terrible and ragged."" 

Following is the long version, but the summary for the ""too lazy, didn't read"" brigade is:

1. Emacs ""fontsets"" seem like they are still the way to do Unicode font configuration.
2. I can't make them work.
3. The documentation is long on reference material, and short on examples.
4. So is the Internet.
5. I hate everything now.
6. Also, my Unicode fonts outside the ASCII range still suck.

Eventually I discovered using `create-fontset-from-ascii-font` to create `fontset-custom` would actually work.  Not especially intuitively, thanks to the less than intuitive font selection order of `x-resolve-font-name` without additional rules, but it worked.

Key questions:

* is creating a fontset the ""best practice"" at all?
* is it expected that I must create a custom fontset, and cannot use the standard or default fontset?
* is `(set-face-attribute 'default nil :name ""fontset-custom"")` the ""expected"" way to declare use of that custom fontset?
* why are those auto-generated Courier based fontsets created when using standard and/or default?

I appreciate y'all helping, as I'd like to better understand the whys of this, and neither the manual nor the source are very effective at doing so.  Once I finally know what the best way to handle this is I can go about sending in a documentation patch, though, so at least the next person doesn't go through this. :)

--------
## The full story

To abuse a quotation, ""now I have two problems"", one of which is figuring out how to do this; the last time I touched non-ASCII font configuration was when I was using XEmacs on GNU/Linux a decade ago, and now I'm using GNU Emacs, on macOS, so kind of a different universe.

It looks like the solution from the era is still the best practice today, though: build a fontset that contains the desired character range to font mappings, and use that everywhere.  Which sounds so simple, but ... now I have three problems. :/

According to the documentation, I should be able to use a fontset name as the `:name` attribute of a face.  However...

```elisp
(fontset-name-p ""fontset-default"")  ;; => t which is not really a surprise

;; set my font for ASCII, just because...
M-x describe-fontset <RET> fontset-default <RET>
Fontset: -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-default
CHAR RANGE (CODE RANGE)
    FONT NAME (REQUESTED and [OPENED])
;; elided
 ..  (#x80 .. #x9F)
    -*-Input Mono-*-*-*-*-*-140-*-*-*-*-*-*
	[-*-Input Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-14-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1]
;; elided

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :family nil :foundry nil :font ""fontset-default"")
;; https://imgur.com/a/xyTESoz -- that doesn't look like Input Mono very much...

M-x describe-fontset <RET> <RET>  ;; show the fontset in use
Fontset: -*-Courier-normal-normal-normal-*-10-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto2
CHAR RANGE (CODE RANGE)
    FONT NAME (REQUESTED and [OPENED])
;; elided
 .. ʯ (#x80 .. #x2AF)
    -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
	[-*-Courier-normal-normal-normal-*-10-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1]

C-u C-x =  ;; tell me about my character
             position: 5790 of 14921 (39%), column: 0
            character: e (displayed as e) (codepoint 101, #o145, #x65)
    preferred charset: ascii (ASCII (ISO646 IRV))
              display: by this font (glyph code)
    mac-ct:-*-Courier-normal-normal-normal-*-10-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1 (#x48)

;; repeat using `""fontset-standard""`, get same results.
```

So, clearly giving the fontset name -- despite it being valid, says the manual -- isn't working as expected.  I'm being thrown over to an unexpected, auto-generated fontset using the wrong font, rather than the one I requested.

`fontset-alias-alist` contains no references to `fontset-default` on the left, so we are not remapping that during fontset lookup in [xfaces.c:3161](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d77d01d22902acdc45c2c7059de4f1b158ab5806/src/xfaces.c#L3161).  

A stroll through the rest of the code turns up the wonderful, and undocumented in the Info manual, and the docstring, existence of the [apparently valid `:fontset` attribute name](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d77d01d22902acdc45c2c7059de4f1b158ab5806/src/xfaces.c#L6537).

This is [much simpler code for setting the fontset of the face](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d77d01d22902acdc45c2c7059de4f1b158ab5806/src/xfaces.c#L3203) but, sadly, the behaviour is unchanged: the fontset may have the appropriate font configured, but it does not use it, preferring to give me another newly generated fontset instead.

Finally, in desperation I tried creating my own fontset and ... after a couple of false starts, it actually worked, and I could apply it as the default ""font"" for the default face:

```elisp
;; curiously, I had to specify a medium weight, or I would get the ultralight oblique variant...
(create-fontset-from-ascii-font ""Input Mono-14:medium"" nil ""custom"")
(fontset-name-p ""fontset-custom"")  ;; => t
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font ""fontset-custom"")

M-x describe-fontset <RET> <RET>  ;; even though it is visually correct
Fontset: -*-Input Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-14-*-*-*-m-0-fontset-auto5
CHAR RANGE (CODE RANGE)
    FONT NAME (REQUESTED and [OPENED])
C-@ .. DEL
    -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
 ..  (#x80 .. #x9F)
    -*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
	[-*-Input Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-14-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1]
;; elided
```

...and finally I have a fontset working.  That means that I can configure it, using the standard fontset mechanisms, to render any Unicode code point via any typeface I wish, with the appropriate properties applied to scale, etc, it to the right place.

So, I guess my key question is as follows:

Is this the correct way to make a fontset work, creating my own custom one, and ignoring the default and standard fontsets?  Is there something I missed about how fontsets are intended to be constructed in the manual or something, explaining this?

Also, is this the ""correct"" strategy for getting fine-grained control over typeface selection in Emacs on both X11 and NS GUI Emacs instances?

"So I have finally decided to try out `exwm` and almost immediately regretted not trying it out sooner. It took me couple of days to figure out various `X11`, `yabar` and `dunst` settings to make things manageable and ready to be used as my primary window manager.

I am already crazy about Emacs but this thing potentially can take things to a completely different level for me.
Now I have all sorts of crazy ideas and tons of questions. Can you guys help me finding my zen by throwing some ideas and suggestions?
I am sorry for too many bullet points here, *of course I don't expect to find answers to every one of them*.

- How can I rebind native keys in apps (that's possible right?). For example how can I make that tabs switching in a browser done via `Super+h/l`? Or how can I make `C-n/C-p` work globally for `down/up`?

- How can I feed Emacs's arbitrary stuff onto `yabar`? e.g. I want to display `org-clock-current-task` in it. Is that doable?

- Are `exwm-workspaces` is really a good way? Maybe `persp.el` AKA `Spacemacs layouts` would be better?
  So for example I could probably make it that every app, whenever opened creates its own layout and places itself in there? And then I can make it possible to jump to any app, and when that happens, Emacs would take me to layout where the app sits.

- Is there such a thing as a list of `exwm` apps/windows that should always open in floating mode?

- How do you deal with a pinentry dialog? It sometimes appears kinda crammed and I can't see the input where I supposed to type things.

"My fellow Emacs Lisp developers, what are you currently working on?  As for me, in my spare time (in no particular order of priority)...

1. Fixing bugs for `php-auto-yasnippets` that have existed for *far,* **far** too long.
2. `defcli`: A package to easily create an Elisp interface to any command-line program that uses sub-commands, e.g. Git, Tup, jrnl, et alia.
3. A major mode for jrnl.
4. A major mode for jq.
5. A major mode for twtxt.
6. Reddit-comment support for `copy-as-format`.
7. An Ivy-based version of `helm-gitignore`.
8. A small wrapper around `ivy-read` to make the common use-cases more concise.
9. Various Ivy-based utilities taking advantage of that conciseness mentioned above.
10. Something I am calling `prefix-postfix-keys`, which is a way to bind keys in a mode in a way where they will only invoke their bound functions when pressing the key at the beginning or end of a line.  See the Lispy and Worf packages by /u/abo-abo to see that exact concept in practice.  Honestly all I'm doing is generalizing his work in those packages so that it is easier to create such bindings for any mode.
11. An addition to Lua Mode using aforementioned Lispy and Worf-ish style commands
12. A major mode for Just.
13. `M-x compile` and Projectile support for Tup.
14. `dvorakify`: A package for people like me who have used the Dvorak keyboard layout for nearly two decades at this point.  The package changes the default keys of many packages to make them easier to use for Dvorak layouts.  For example, Avy uses the Qwerty homerow for letting you jump to the most likely matches.  But those keys are not remotely as convenient when using Dvorak.  So this `dvorakify` package does stuff like reconfigures Avy for you so that it uses the Dvorak homerow.
15. A mode for reading EPUB documents.  The existing `ox-epub` exports Org Mode files into EPUB documents, but this mode will let you read EPUB files within Emacs.

I am sure a good chunk of these ideas are already implemented by people smarter and better than myself.  And if you know if any packages that do anything I listed above, *please* let me know.  I will very much appreciate it.

So that's most of my list.  What about the rest of you?  What are you working on?  Anything remotely similar?  (Because if so I'd be happy to collaborate.)  And finally if you are working on one or more Elisp packages---happy hacking!

"Robert Chassell was the author of ""An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp"". He passed away on June 30th.

I remember watching a while ago (and again recently) a video of John Wiegley with Sacha Chua where Wiegley says ""there are no good introductions to emacs lisp"" and after searching the info browser for the elisp reference and finding the intro there  says ""Oh, wait, there is one! Everybody should read this!"", or something like this...

That book is probably not the best introduction anymore to Lisp or elisp, but it introduces to a lot of concepts specific to emacs and elisp. As Wiegley said, everybody who is interested in elisp writing (especially amateurs) should read the book (or the info file).

"Just wanted to let you know that the mooc/course which introduced me to Emacs and Functional Programming is starting again. Although the course is not about Emacs it is required in the first part of the course and can be used throughout.

The second part will teach you programming concepts in Racket. Since Racket is a Scheme it can serve as an introduction to Emacs Lisp as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend this course for anyone who learns Emacs Lisp on his own without any functional programming background. I did not complete the course the last time but it really got me started to get behind the Introduction to Emacs Lisp level. Besides that it is the best online course I have ever taken.

If anyone is interested, I participate in the current course again and it would be great to find some others from this channel to form some kind of Emacs/Elisp interested people 
kind of learning group. 

The course already started but registration is still open:

"A couple weeks ago, [I mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2y469e/things_that_make_you_feel_like_stuck_in_the_80s/cp69ced) that I would love to be able to assign modes to windows in Emacs, so that when I switch buffer or open new files, they go into the window dedicated to the appropriate mode.  The ever helpful /u/tuhdo mentioned that maybe [purpose](https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose) would be a helpful mode to try.

I have used purpose for a over a week now, and so far I find it to be exactly what I was looking for!

The OCaml, Terminal and Compilation windows were dedicated to their own purpose, while the Circe window had no specific purpose and thus was also used to display help buffers, twitter notifications, etc.

Purpose does a great job at integrating with my own particular workflow (e.g. it supposes that you use ido to switch buffers), and I love that it stays out of the way rather than force me to adopt entirely new habits.  The configuration is easy and flexible, and the benefits (at least for me) of being able to concentrate on my work rather than on managing an ever-changing window layout are very compelling.

I highly encourage you to try it for yourself and see if that is something you'd like to include in your Emacs workflow.  Happy emacsing!",22,53,A quick praise of purpose mode,emacs

"Hello emacsen,

I have noticed some changes in the EmacsWiki's [GuileEmacs page](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GuileEmacs), with information on GSOC 2014.

I am glad to see some progress but the wiki has little info about the current state of the project and I cannot find any recent discussion on the subject.

I think some feedback would be interesting and beneficial for the community.

With some answer to questions like :

* What have been done ?
* What still need to be done ?
* How can we help to bring it alive ?
* etc

At that point I have hard time understanding if Guile Emacs is a real project with the support of the community or a [toy|personal] project for GSoC participants.

"I'm curious as to people's opinions on [Dired](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode), and what if any dislikes they have, or tips for use.

I'm writing this because I hope to inspire some people who have not tried dired to give it a shot.  I took a very long time after starting to use emacs to seriously try out dired: I'd been using emacs for years before that point, and really regret not having tried it beforehand.

I don't see a huge number of posts about it on here, and I wonder a bit whether perhaps a lot of people were just like me: holding off and having not really tried it.

For those who have not used dired, it's a file-manager that displays a menu of files and directories and permits operating on them.  The closest program to dired I'd seen beforehand would probably have been [Midnight Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander).

I really like using dired or other file-managers when operating on files that are hard-to-specify-by-name, like filenames with foreign language characters in them or where I need to see the list of files to pick from.

Some basics: you can get into dired by hitting `C-x d`.  If you're not using ido-mode, simply using `C-x f` and opening a directory will also work.  Once in, ^ will move up a directory, navigating to a directory and hitting RET will enter it, and navigating to a file and hitting RET will open it.

You can also get a dired buffer containing a selected set of files: try `M-x find-name-dired` or `M-x find-grep-dired`.

You can flag files for deletion with ""d"" and execute flagged deletions with ""x"".  Hit ""R"" to rename or move a file, and ""C"" to copy it.  There is a [lot more to dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html), but that was enough to start me out when I started out.

Some init.el snippits that I find helpful for dired:

dired is smart about .tar.gz files, and lets one open a browser simply by hitting RET while point is on one.  It's also possible to make it do the same with .zip files:

    ;; Handle zip compression
    (eval-after-load ""dired-aux""
      '(add-to-list 'dired-compress-file-suffixes
                    '(""\\.zip\\'"" "".zip"" ""unzip"")))

I use ibuffer for my C-x C-b binding instead of list-buffers.  This has the ability to group buffers.  I tend to wind up with a lot of dired buffers, so it's nice to group them together:

    (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
          (quote ((""default""
                   (""dired"" (mode . dired-mode))))))

By default, dired spends a lot of screen space showing the permissions and owner and modification time and so forth of a file: more than half of an 80 column display.  I very rarely want to refer to this material...I'd rather use the space for filenames.  There's a nice package called dired-details that will hide this by default and permit hiding and showing that information with `(` and `)`, and an add-on to that called dired-details+.  Some of the systems I work on have dired-details+ installed, and some don't, so I use it if present, and if not, ignore it so that loading my init file won't fail.

There's also a nice add-on called diredful, which permits assigning faces to particular filetypes.  I like to color-code images and .exe files, so I load that if present as well:

    ;;; Dired
    ;; Use details
    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook 'my-dired-load-hook)
    (defun my-dired-load-hook ()

      (if (require 'dired-details+ nil t)
          (setq dired-details-propagate-flag nil)

        (progn (message ""Notice: dired-details+ not present"")
               ;; If we don't have dired-details+, at least try for dired-details alone
               (if (require 'dired-details nil t)
                   (dired-details-install)
                 (message ""Notice: dired-details not present""))))
      (setq-default diredful-init-file ""~/.emacs-diredful.el"")
      ;; We can function on systems without diredful, even though it's nice to have
      (if (not (require 'diredful nil t))
          (message
           ""Notice: diredful not present; not using extended highlighting"")))

By default, dired shows filesizes in bytes.  This uses up a lot of screen space, and is usually not very useful to read: I almost never want the exact byte-size of a file, but rather a summary of how large it is.

Also, many file browsers these days auto-detect numeric fields, and if they are present, sort files numerically by that field instead of lexicographically.  And example would be three files: foo-1.zip, foo-9.zip, foo-14.zip.  By default, dired will first list foo-1.zip, then foo-14.zip, then foo-9.zip, because ""1"" comes before ""9"".  However, it's possible to ask dired to sort things numerically.  Here's how I ask for human-readable sizes and files sorted numerically:

    ;; Make sizes human-readable by default, sort version numbers
    ;; correctly, and put dotfiles and capital-letters first.
    (setq-default dired-listing-switches ""-alhv"")

Normally, when I try to copy a directory, dired asks me if I really want to do a recursive copy.  I always want to do this, and even if I didn't, the cost of accidentally starting a recursive copy isn't really all that bad.  This stops dired from prompting me:

    (setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)

Dired can execute a command on the file that point is currently on if you hit `!`.  However, this is a blocking operation: nothing else can happen in emacs while this is running.  This is obviously a problem if one wants to, say, play a movie or do some other long-running operation.  `&` will start the command in the background.  Unfortunately, that stores the command's output in a buffer named ""Async Shell Command"" which will cause two running programs to crash into each other and complain.  It's possible to ask dired to come up with a unique name for each:

    ;; Allow running multiple async commands simultaneously
    (defadvice shell-command (after shell-in-new-buffer (command &optional output-buffer error-buffer))
      (when (get-buffer ""*Async Shell Command*"")
        (with-current-buffer ""*Async Shell Command*""
          (rename-uniquely))))
    (ad-activate 'shell-command)

I use [emms](https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/), an emacs-based playlist manager and media player frontend.  I like having a keybinding to add the media files in an entire directory tree to emms from dired.

I also like to have an easy way to enter wdired, and do so with `C-c e`.  Instead of renaming a file one at a time, it's possible to use wdired, where a dired buffer becomes editable.  Make all the filename changes you want, using all of emacs' powerful text-editing tools, and then just hit C-c C-c when done to apply the changes.

    (defun my-dired-mode-hook ()
      ;; Let us have a key that puts the dired buffer into interactive renaming mode
      (local-set-key (kbd ""C-c e"") 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
      (local-set-key (kbd ""M-p p"") 'emms-add-dired)
      )

    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
              'my-dired-mode-hook)

I sometimes use dired to open various sorts of files, and it's nice to be able to have dired be able to suggest the type automatically:

    (defun add-dired-extension-list (command extension-list)
      (mapc (lambda (extension)
              (add-to-list 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user (list extension command)))
            extension-list))


    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
              (function (lambda ()
                          (load ""dired-x"")

A common paradigm in text-based file managers is the two-pane [orthodox file manager](http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml); Norton Commander and Midnight Commander are among these.  I'm not a tremendous fan of these, but they do have one very nice feature: I often work with two directories, and do things like want to do many operations where I move files from one directory to another.  It's possible to ask dired to, if there are two dired windows open, suggest the other as a target for operations from the first:

    ;; Try suggesting dired targets
    (setq dired-dwim-target t)

"Another week, another trick. For this week, we will take a look at your new best friend for programming, if it isn't already, [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck)! I don't know about you, but in my early years with GNU Emacs, one of my first frustrations was to not be able to get the syntax checking on the fly during programming, like does many of IDEs. Maybe some of you are still using `flymake` to achieve this request, but I highly recommend to switch over `flycheck`. One of the main reasons is that `flycheck` receives more contributions and is therefore updated more often, a big point for the race of crazy languages with syntaxes that we know (look [here](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/flycheck-versus-flymake.html#flycheck-versus-flymake) for more information) 😊

[Overview of flycheck.](https://i.redd.it/jhneuag2w0d11.png)

The picture above illustrates `flycheck` in action for the SCSS language. For instance, we can see that `flycheck` does not find the `font-size` property since I have not finished assigning it a value. Sweet isn't it?

A basic configuration of the package can be done by following:

    (use-package flycheck
      :defer 2
      :diminish
      :init (global-flycheck-mode)
      :custom
      (flycheck-display-errors-delay .3)
      (flycheck-stylelintrc ""~/.stylelintrc.json""))

In short, we going to enable `flycheck` for every modes, we give the configuration file for [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and also change the default delay to display errors. You are free to make this configuration as complex as you wish.

It is important to note that `flycheck` uses an external program to enable this syntax check. Therefore, it requires you to install the desired packages for the languages you are going to use.

The question you are probably asking yourself is how to integrate `flycheck` for the language you use on a daily basis. Nothing simpler, just go to the [website](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html) of this package, a section exists for that. Once you know the packages to install, just install them and inform `flycheck` by configuring the appropriate variables.

Finally, you can check your configuration in the appropriate buffer with the `flycheck-verify-setup` (`C-c ! v`) command.

[Overview of flycheck-verify-setup.](https://i.redd.it/a9mnvz7rx0d11.png)

The above picture shows that `flycheck` knows `scss-stylelint` well.

**NOTE:** it is possible to configure several checkers and easily change them with: `flycheck-select-checker` (`C-c ! s`).

Without going into details, it is also possible to create your own checker, I refer you to the documentation to do this.

Here is the `hydra` menu that I daily use for `flycheck`:

    (use-package hydra
      :defer 2
      :bind (""C-c f"" . hydra-flycheck/body))
    
    (defhydra hydra-flycheck (:color blue)
      ""
      ^
      ^Flycheck^          ^Errors^            ^Checker^
      ^────────^──────────^──────^────────────^───────^─────
      _q_ quit            _<_ previous        _?_ describe

      _v_ verify setup    _f_ check           _m_ mode
      ^^                  _l_ list            _s_ select
      ^^                  ^^                  ^^
      ""
      (""q"" nil)
      (""<"" flycheck-previous-error :color pink)
      ("">"" flycheck-next-error :color pink)
      (""?"" flycheck-describe-checker)
      (""M"" flycheck-manual)
      (""d"" flycheck-disable-checker)

      (""m"" flycheck-mode)
      (""s"" flycheck-select-checker)
      (""v"" flycheck-verify-setup))

Which gives this nice menu:

"I'm in day two of a trial of REmacs which has astounded me. [The simple fact that my config](https://github.com/ocodo/.emacs.d) spins up without a single alteration.

Given that my config is, without the slightest exaggeration, vast, I was really surprised that REmacs is now stable enough that it works.

I'm posting this for a couple of reasons, one, if you haven't tried REmacs yet, and you have even a basic knowledge of building software from source, go ahead. (I built it by following the `.travis.yml` file.)

If you have tried it and had problems, I think now is the time to jump in again.  It's also a great time to consider contributing to the project, if you're interested!

"Someone asked me [in this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/5jdb7q/a_quick_guide_to_orgmode_todos/dbfbns9/) if I could share some of my setup to get everything into Emacs & org mode. So here's how I get stuff from my browser and my phone into Emacs and org-mode. I'm assuming familiarity with Emacs, org-mode, and org-capture. 

# Browser

I use EWW most of the time, and org-capturing from there is dead simple. Otherwise, I use Firefox. There's [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/org-mode-capture/) that captures webpages.* When you're looking at a webpage, you can just hit a key combo to automatically capture it. I've got it set to `C-M-t`, which I believe is the default. To use it, you need to have an Emacs server running `(server-start)` and you need to `(require 'org-protocol)`. You'll also need to tell it what capture template to use. Go to the addon preferences and let it know what letter you want to use. I chose ""x"". Here's my capture template for ""x"":

    (""x"" ""firefox"" entry (file+headline (concat org-directory ""todo.org"") ""Firefox"") ""* TODO %c"" :immediate-finish t)

This inserts a new subheader in my todo.org file under the ""Firefox"" header. It is a link with the description as the webpage's title. 

# Mobile 

Phones are great for discovering new content, for consuming small amounts of content, and are super useful because they're always on you. They're less great for actually consuming information or figuring out complicated things. So there's quite a bit that I start to look at but want to come back to later on my laptop/desktop. So I wanted to figure out a way to org-capture various things from my phone. I could [run Emacs on Android](http://endlessparentheses.com/running-emacs-on-android.html), but that seemed... a bit much. So this is what I settled on. It works OK for most things. The worst part about it is that it relies on a whole bunch of companies and closed-source services. If anyone knows friendly open-source alternatives, please let me know! 

1. Sign up for IFTTT and Dropbox
2. Create an IFTTT applet: the IF part is if I send (IFTTT's phone number) an SMS from (my phone number), THEN append to a text file in my Dropbox
   1. I made the file name ifttt (Dropbox actually appends the "".txt"" extension afterwards and I don't think you can change that)
   2. Content: `* TODO {{Message}}`
   3. Dropbox folder path `org/` 

Now you can send any text to IFTTT's phone number and it will automatically get added to that file in your dropbox. Pretty neat, and great for jotting down notes on the go. You can also ""share"" things from most any app (firefox, etc) on your phone to an SMS app on your phone. Then just send whatever was ""shared"" to IFTTT. This works great with text and links; I haven't tried it with pictures or such. 

I also set up a repeating TODO in my main todo.org file that reminds me to refile everything in ifttt.txt every 2ish days:

    * TODO [#C] refile [[file:ifttt.txt][IFTTT reads]]
        SCHEDULED: <2016-12-22 Thu .+2d>

# Web apps 

The other neat thing you can do with IFTTT is to set up Pocket, which is a sort of ""read it later"" service. I have one applet that says if I add something new to Pocket, append to the previously-mentioned ifttt.txt file in Dropbox. Here is the content it adds:

    * TODO {{Title}} - {{Url}}<br>{{Excerpt}}<br>

That in and of itself is neat, but it becomes much more powerful when you combine it with a few other applets. For example, I have one that saves links from tweets that I ""favorite"" to pocket. So essentially I can just ""favorite"" a tweet with a link to read the link later. I do something similar with RSS feeds - I use feedly and mark the ""save for later"" button, which adds it to Pocket, which writes it to my ifttt.txt file. There's a ton of different web apps you can hook up this way.

"Oh my God! I gave emacs a shot, and I think I am here to stay! 
It is so fun to tweak and play with emacs, configuring it in elisp is much more intuitive and fun
than viml. I used vim for about 2 years, never considered my self a vim-guru, but I got quite 
used to it.

Few week ago I decided to give functional programming a shot, it looks fun and intuitive. So I
got into Scheme, goofing around with math and I quite enjoyed. But I have never ever thought that
I could go on Emacs side of things in terms of text editors. It scared me a lot! Its community, its robustness...
It is huge. Like an OS. I just jumped into it and gave it a shot. For few days I didn't do anything else that playing
with packages, and trying to tweak things to my liking. Things are pretty swift and reactive for now, but I have
seen huge emacs configs where they contained few thousands of lines, so I guess that stories about slow emacs
are true for those usages, not mine. 

But what shocked me the most is that emacs actually makes much more sense, at least to me! Everything
from configuring, to using. I got that modular Vim approach, I kinda got used to it, but hell it took me a
long time and nerve wrecking. Maybe I got more patient and adaptive during those 2 years with Vim, so when
I jumped on emacs it wasn't as shocking and hard as it was with Vim, since previous to vim I used only Sublime Text.

But now I think I am here to stay. And I am shocked, again, how much sense emacs make. If you want to use it
as OS, cool use it, if you want to use it as LISP IDE ok use it, if you want to use it as writing app, ok... I will use
it as text editor, boost in productivity is noticeable just after a week. I imagine how much I will enjoy after few years!

"In every major mode I've tried, including the mini-buffer, `M-(` inserts a pair of balanced parentheses. 

    ()

If you give a numeric prefix argument, it will enclose that many sexps following point within the parens. Try typing this in a buffer:

    list 2 3 5 7 11

With point at the end of that line, type `C-a` to move point to the beginning of the line. Then type `C-u 6` followed by `M-(`. You should see the following:

    (list 2 3 5 7 11)

Giving a negative numeric prefix argument encloses that many sexps *before* point. Delete the previous line or start a fresh one and type the following:

    + 2 3 5 7 11

Don't press `C-a`. With point still at the end of the line, type `C-u - 6` (that's `C-u` then `-` then `6`) to give numeric prefix argument *-6* (negative six). Then type `M-(` and you should see this:

"Hi, I'm moving to London and came across the [Transport for London API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk). The API gives access to an amazing amount of information, so I started creating an interface in Emacs for fun and learn a little emacs lisp on the way.

The result is [org-tfl](https://github.com/storax/org-tfl)! You can plan journeys and either view the result in a buffer or insert a special org section (see [screencast](https://github.com/storax/org-tfl#screencast)).
The idea of the org mode section is to have a heading with a special link. When you open the link, the journey will be queried from the api and the result will be placed below the heading. The link description gets updated too. You can use org properties and the scheduling functions to specify all parameters. I find it useful, when you have a regular schedule. This way I can see the itinerary result summary in agenda view for example and it informs if there are any disruptions.

"Hey everyone,

So I wanted list some things I'm doing to use/learn Emacs as I search for a job. For those curious, I switched career fields 2 years ago and I've been doing I.T consulting since then. Mainly helping small businesses with computer repair and website services. But now I want to search for job because I want more stability financially. I'm currently looking for jobs in the Linux/open source world.

So why learn Emacs? Well I had 2 goals; first learn something new so I can stay busy, second get rid of some paid/closed source apps I was using. When I discovered Org-mode I had to take the time to learn Emacs. Here's a list of stuff I replaced with Emacs.

1. [Notion.so](https://Notion.so)
2. Google Keep
3. [Atom.io](https://Atom.io)
4. Scribus
5. Planner/Bullet Journal

[Notion.so](https://Notion.so) is basically Org-mode but in a web-app, so that was an easy transition. ~~The only thing that Org-mode can't do is image/link previews~~. Other than that Org-mode is superior for 2 reasons, offline support and keyboard navigation shortcuts. Google Keep was another easy one since all I use Keep for is short notes and links. Also I should note that I found a cool android app called [orgzly](http://www.orgzly.com/) that I use to sync with my *org*  notes on my desktop. Atom editor was easy since it's basically an editor, I just had to find an Emacs theme that matched the one I use in Atom. Once I found all the amazing export functions that Org-mode I had to say goodbye to Scribus.

The most interesting one that I was able to replace was my planner. I use the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) system for keep track of my todo's and agenda. Org-mode once again turned out to be able to do everything that I was doing in my bullet journal. The best part is that I can now easily recall and search my notes, todo's, and agenda. If you used the bullet journal system, you know it can be a pain to recall something from a few month ago.

So am I happy with Emacs? Yes! Emacs is awesome and Org-mode is simply amazing.

* I like programming language research, and a not-insignificant amount of research programming languages are emacs-centric

"One thing that I do is make universal use of emacs in a terminal — that is, a virtual terminal program (urxvt) is displaying emacs.  I never use graphical emacs.  I see a number of people who do do so.  I've tried that before, but on the whole came down on the side of use in a terminal.  I wanted to throw a few benefits of exclusively using emacs in a terminal out there, and a few of the challenges and workarounds.

First, the downsides.  Cons of terminal use everywhere:

* **No [fringe](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fringes.html) available.**  This narrow strip down the side of the window can be useful to pack a bit more information into the window.  I've occasionally wished for this to be available -- there are some packages that do some useful things with it -- but it's not really core to using emacs.

* **Face coloration is less-extensive.**  Graphical emacs gets 24-bit color.  These days, terminals pretty much all have 256-bit color support, and some have 24-bit color support.  I've found that this isn't a big deal -- even a 16 color foreground on a 16 color background is sufficient to display pretty much all the information I want.  One thing that people want is to make text more-visible (a blue-on-black is hard to read) or reduce contrast (bright white on black can be a bit overpowering).  I dealt with the contrast and readability by just setting my virtual terminal's colors, since, really, the readability issues affected *all* software in the terminal -- the problem was one with a vanilla terminal in general, not just with emacs.  I use a color scheme that IIRC started as [solarized dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and got tweaked.  For those of you using an X11 environment, and xterm or urxvt, from my ~/.Xresources:

        #define S_base03        #252525
        #define S_base01        #00d040
        #define S_base1         #70a1a1

        *background:            S_base03

        !! white dark/light
        *color7:                #909090
        *color15:               #f0f0f0

    (If you're not familiar with ~/.Xresources, you'll need to have something run `xrdb ~/.Xresources` at some point after your X11 environment comes up to apply these settings.  I'm not sure whether GNOME/KDE/etc do this these days out-of-box.)

* **Some face properties are not available.**  You don't get to set font size, and don't get italicized characters.  Underline is available.  Haven't found anything really important here (and personally actually tried to avoid font size and italicization even back when I wasn't in a terminal...haven't really tried to put up with that since xemacs).

* **Images are not available.**  This is a bit of a niche, but browsing a directory with dired, one might want image thumbnails.  BBDB can show image thumbnails of contacts, as I recall.  Not really vital to emacs, but I can understand it being annoying to someone who *does* want to use this functionality locally.

    In theory, one might imagine TTY emacs gaining support for Sixel – at least for [xterm operating in a non-default mode, raster graphics can be displayed remotely](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2114347/raster-graphics-in-xterm), and hypothetically emacs could be made to understand this and [display images](https://gist.github.com/hackerb9/a96cea91e6122d09a6c97f5eb797d5fa).  However, this is definitely not a common situation.

* **Multiple frames do not produce multiple windows** (in the parent environment sense of ""window"", like X11, not the emacs sense).  Certain emacs software, like [ediff](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/htmlₘono/ediff.html) or [speedbar](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/htmlₙode/emacs/Speedbar.html), open a new frame intended to be visible alongside the parent one.  This can be a useful mechanism.  Both can still be used without.  For ediff, one just gets another emacs window in non-graphical mode.  For speedbar, one can just switch to another frame in non-graphical mode and only see speedbar *or* the buffer one is working on.

* **Mouse-based copy-paste has limitations**.  I don't use the mouse to move text around in emacs, but it's a useful way to move data between emacs and another program.  In a terminal, Emacs cannot distinguish between the user typing characters and one pasting using the virtual terminal's paste functionality.  If you use, say electric-newline and paste Python, you'll get a stair-stepped indent.  If you have your terminal horizontally split (`C-x 3`), copying multiple lines of text in one window will include text from the other window.  If you have emacs displaying a continuation character and are copying text at a line-break, that gets included.  You cannot copy more than a page of text else the modeline will be embedded in the text.

    In practice, I've found that this isn't as-severe an issue as it might seem -- I rarely move text out of emacs, and the bulk of pasting text into emacs is tiny snippets or URLs from a web browser.  I do have this fix for the ""copying"" problem that uses `xsel`, but I honestly don't really ever make use of it.  In my `~/emacs.d/init.el`:

        ;; Permit kill-saving text to and from to X11 clipboard; beats the
        ;; heck out of manually copying with the cursor.
        (defun kill-save-to-x-clipboard ()
          (interactive)
          (progn
            (shell-command-on-region (region-beginning) (region-end) ""xsel -i"")
            (message ""Kill-saved region to clipboard!"")
            (deactivate-mark)))

        (global-set-key (kbd ""C-c k"") 'kill-save-to-x-clipboard)

        (defun yank-from-x-clipboard ()
          (interactive)
          (progn
            (insert (shell-command-to-string ""xsel -o"")))
            (message ""Yanked region from clipboard!""))

        (global-set-key (kbd ""C-c y"") 'yank-from-x-clipboard)

    If you want to make use of the mouse to select the region for the above `kill-save-to-x-clipboard` in xterm or urxvt, you can do so with [`xterm-mouse-mode`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Text_002dOnly-Mouse.html).

Pros of pure terminal use:

* **Fantastic for remote use.**  I do a fair bit of remote use of Linux computers.  And the terminal is simply the best way to do that, by far.  It's friendly to high (or variable) latency, friendly to low bandwidth.  Emacs collects some of the best modern terminal-friendly software out there under one roof, which means that if you want to work in a terminal a lot, using emacs is a great way to do it.

    This includes the ability to detach and reattach (via [GNU `screen`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) or via [`tmux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux)) to workspaces.  I tended to never shut down my working environment — just attach and reattach to it.  There is no graphical environment that I'm aware of that does this as-cleanly.  Sure, I can use VNC or similar to reattach to a graphical environment, but doing all one's work in VNC, even over a low-latency, high-throughput connection is not great.  VNC is a workaround for graphical environments that were never intended to be used remotely.

    For very high-latency or unreliable connections, one can replace `ssh` with [`mosh`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosh_\(software\)).  Working in any graphical environment with, say, 200 milliseconds of delay is painful.  Working in a terminal with mosh with 200 milliseconds of delay isn't ideal, but is certainly doable.

    It is true that emacs *also* has unparalleled capabilities to have a local graphical instance running against files on a remote machine.  Use of [TRAMP](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/htmlₙode/emacs/Remote-Files.html) lets one open and work on remote files fairly transparently.  Add that to a remarkable amount of support in various emacs packages to transparently ""just work"" on the remote machine when editing a remote file (building and searching files, say), and one might viably make a workflow around a local emacs instance working via TRAMP.  My preference for the ability to just detach from my workspace as a whole made this less-desirable, though I do use this occasionally to edit a lone file on a system that doesn't have emacs installed.

* **No problems switching between terminal and X11**.  There was a long time when I tried living in both worlds -- use graphical emacs locally, terminal emacs remotely.  This was somewhat unsatisfying.  IIRC, emacs now has the ability to let one attach both X11 and TTY emacsclient instances to a single daemon, but my experience was that that tended to crash into software that thought that it was in pure X11-land and had set faces that only contrasted well in X11, and X11-dependent tidbits tended to creep into my workflow.  As long as I avoid using graphical emacs locally, working on a machine remotely becomes a non-issue.

    For example, if one copy-pastes with the mouse in a terminal, one positions point where one wants the paste to occur.  If one does so in a graphical window, one middle-clicks where one wants the paste to occur.  A small difference, but it's certainly annoying for muscle memory, and those tiny differences add up.

* **Marginally faster startup time**.  Not a huge deal, but the GTK builds of emacs tended to take longer to come up the last time I was timing them.

Basically I've been trying to use org for everything: managing todos, writing articles with citations, managing bibliographic references, storing interesting links to read, concept mapping with org-brain etc. etc. I got a pretty good system working but at some point it started to feel stretched, e.g. the massive org-bibtex files and lists of links were slowing down agenda and org-id. I never got round to checking my agenda and the complexity of maintaining all my little hacks started to feel like a cognitive strain.

I ended up using org where it's really amazing, quickly writing and outlining notes, and took my todos, links etc. elsewhere.

"It's no secret that Emacs is a text editor with a lot of functionality and that no one uses all that functionality.  That's fine, we should use Emacs in a way that feels easy and natural rather than trying to always be optimal in all our interactions.  Still, it is good to learn new tricks and sometimes we hear about a new command or a new package that improves our editing habits, even if only slightly.  Why don't we share some of those small changes that we've incorporated in our workflows recently?

I'll name three from the past weeks:

1. Using `M-a` and `M-e` to move in prose.  I was writing my thesis and moving by sentence was a great way to quickly go where I wanted with a little less character- by-character movement.
2. I've reactivated window-purpose mode; I talked about purpose before, but for some reason had disabled it.  Being able to create a window layout and have buffers go to the appropriate windows without any interaction from my part is subtle time saver: much less `C-x 0` and company.
3. I've started using `M-x remember` to keep a log of my day.  I've bound it to an easy keyboard shortcut and it's only a few seconds to bring up the remember buffer, enter a small note, save it and go back to work.

"I've spent a good number of hours trying to make the transition to emacs for development. I am really drawn to the simplicity of getting to know and use one diverse tool as the hub of my development work. **But** it just doesn't seem possible. Especially after watching and reading some very long-time emacs users essentially admit that certain things about it just aren't as good as IDE's can offer. I just watched Metzger talk about using emacs for an entire career, and he was pretty clear that refactoring just isn't what it needs to be. I've read numerous people admit that completion through the varied different plugins doesn't quite match what a full-fledged IDE can do. I got Semantic working with autocomplete after a few hours and it was painfully slow for even a relatively small library like SDL. I've read that parsing with elisp simply can't match the parsers in IDEs.

So, how do you make it work? Do you just take the good with the bad, and acknowledge that, like everything, working with emacs will have its pros and cons? Is there some magical combination of plugins/modes/tools that I haven't yet found? Like I said, I'm really drawn to the simplicity and extensibility of working with emacs, but seeing people who have used it for decades admitting it falls short in some key areas makes it hard for me to understand how that can be possible, even if I put a lot more hours into it.

"Hi! First time posting here. I just wanted to ask if my mindset about switching makes sense.

It is really starting to annoy me how hackish my configuration for tmux and neovim has become, it's basically a lot of code copied from dozens of different sources, and I really don't feel like learning the VimR configuration language as I don't like anything that resembles bash (same for tmux). It is also kinda hard to make my tmux + vim config work well on all my machines (bash for windows, Mac OS and Arch Linux). And every extension I want to make e.g. some workflow to work on my thesis on Latex involves hacking together some Vim plugin and it feels really ad-hoc and shitty.

I'm thinking since emacs is configured using a dialect of lisp that it's a little more gratifying to mess with, and at least it's just one language and one configuration instead of a bunch for neovim and tmux and such. And I don't think there is anything nearly as powerful as org-mode for vim (really want to try it!).

"So just over a week ago, despite how lovely Atom editor is both visually and intuitively, I kept having this nagging itch... I should go over to Emacs, I should go over to Emacs, I should go... over... to... Emacs...

&#x200B;

After a bit of research, decided that Spacemacs looked pretty lovely, so thought I'd give it a go. 

&#x200B;

First couple of days: F\*\*£$£$ \*£""$$"""" how do you actually even open and save files? Endless nightmarish horrors of key sequences that seem to make the simplest operation inordinately and unnecessarily complex. 

&#x200B;

...now I could have packed it in there...

&#x200B;

But -- it was **so** fast, and the default colour scheme was fantastic, and I knew from its long history it is an inordinately powerful tool when you know what you're doing. 

&#x200B;

So I gritted my teeth. I started reading from the basics. I figured out the most essential commands. I started to install a few packages. 

&#x200B;

I stumbled many times adding lines to my .spacemacs file not understanding why they didn't work -- I'd been careful to enter them correctly. I learned that it was very important to make sure you put them in the right ***place***. 

Most importantly of all, I started to understand -- at a novice level -- its principle philosophy, and why it does everything pretty much completely differently to how other editors do it. 

My fingers started to get a bit faster; I started to start find a nice rhythm. I started to be able to move windows around, and realised experientially, not just intellectually, that THE KEYBOARD WAY is indeed best; the initial brick wall learning curve is repaid 1000 fold.

I have been using 'awesome' window manger under Arch Linux. It is very nice. But then I had a thought - why not just install exwm? Emacs can already handle window placement very nicely. Why not just it it full command? 

Do I really need those fancy little icons? Isn't the window panel a pointless addition, better handled by Emacs buffer model? Shall I...? Shall I.. Shall I GO FULL Emacs? Dare I?

OK. Followed the [exwm Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EXWM) instructions and bound the super key as instructed. 

Launched it. Everything working perfectly first time. 

This is just beautiful. I guess you could say that in the space of a week I have now become a member of the Church of Emacs ;)

My ability level with it is still pitiful. I see people writing lisp like they're writing bracket poetry. I've started on the holy quest of Org-mode mastery. Even with the 2% of it I can use, it is glorious.

Next steps? I guess I should move all of my e-mail, IRC, and other stuff into Emacs now. 

My next plan, is to learn my way through org + HUGO for blogging purposes. And figure out AucTEX. I'd got LaTeX working nicely in Atom, so now I need to get that up and running in Emacs.

For example, I'm working on 2 files and reading manual. Usually manual at a separate window. So I need to switch between 2 files in other window. I'm pressing C-<Righ>/<Left> about 10 times every time I need other file, I've need only 3 buffers but there are plenty of them. 

Other way is to press C-x C-b and this creates a new buffer, to switch to it I need press C-o then choose there right buffer by pressing C-n few times. 

I'm switching between them pretty often and it's demand so many actions, when I'm using browser I'm easily do it by S-<TAB> (but usually don't have more than 5-6 tabs), in IDE there are the same tabs. And as it happens, it's very rare when I need more than 2 active tabs at a time, so I can drag and drop them with mouse together and switch between them fast. And there are no tabs witch I didn't create.

Trying out Confluence I quickly realized how bad it is. It is incredibly stupid and profoundly godawful. I hate their WYSIWYG editor.

Their editor simply put is unusable. You can import new documents in markdown (nothing guarantees they still would be rendered as expected), but editing existing documents is still huge pain.

I'm working on a mode/reader/manager for Pocket.  It's almost ready to be submitted to MELPA, but I'd like to get some third-party testing first.  If you're interested, please give it a try and let me know if you have any issues.

These dependencies are required from MELPA:

* dash
* kv
* ov
* s
* rainbow-identifiers
* org-web-tools

After installing those:

1.  Download `pocket-lib.el` and `pocket-reader.el` from https://github.com/alphapapa/pocket-lib.el and put them in your `load-path`.
2.  Eval `(require 'pocket-reader)`, or put that in your init file if you want.
3.  Run the command `pocket-reader`.
4.  This should prompt you to authorize for the Pocket API.  I've tried to streamline this, and it works okay for me, but this really needs to be tested by other people too.  Follow the directions in the minibuffer.  If you're not sure what to do during this process, run `pocket-reader` again.
5.  After authorizing, `pocket-reader` should load your last 50 items.

You can use these keys and commands in the `*pocket-reader*` buffer:

    ""RET"" pocket-reader-open-url
    ""TAB"" pocket-reader-pop-to-url

"Howdy all - 

I've been meaning to get out of evernote for some time, and with their recent price increase and limitations on free accounts, seems like now is the time to do it.

I wrote up a really short gist that gets the process started. It's not perfect - for example, there are a lot of `#+BEGIN_HTML...#+END_HTML` blocks in the exported notes, but it at least gets everything out of evernote and into emacs org-mode. 

You can find the gist here, and I definitely welcome suggestions on how to improve it! https://gist.github.com/jabranham/31279f60d490b10d101652923706ba19

"Org-mode is really inviting in terms of letting me write my thoughts down.

For a long time before using Org, my method was to list my tasks, then in a few lines describe what worked or didn't for later usage. I kept switching between apps and this information got lost, so I repeated similar tasks and patterns time and time again. My journaling process has the same issue. I used to write whole paragraphs, writing my thoughts down, and then struggle with a similar problem 7 months later, unable to find that one thing I talked about earlier (... ""but I know it's there! Where is it!"")

I have a couple of technical ideas toward the journal which involve capture and sparse trees etc. These are not important right now, that's kind of the easy part. The hard part is to figure out how to meta: how do I build my information about the information.

I know this is not exactly an Org or Emacs problem, but I'd bet many of you use Org for some kind of journaling, and even if not, you probably have good ways to find information later when you come and look for it. I would love to hear some suggestions.

To get started, here are some of my ideas so far:

\- use Categories as I capture info, for things like ""work"" or ""family"" or ""tech"". The problem with these is that they are way, way too broad (work and tech, for example, basically the same thing). I could narrow them down, but then I risk maybe changing them in the future, and if they change, again, I don't know what I'm looking for because I forgot how I used to call something.

\- use tags: for people and locations, this is a good idea. Beyond this, I will forget what I'm using tags for.

\- use a certain headline scheme that would tell me what I'm writing about, but again, too broad, not sure what that would be.

As you can see, I need some help in terms of directions. So... anyone?

\- - - - - - - - 

Got a lot of tips here! Impressive. 

I implemented my journal (and also my first useful capture template, to be honest) yesterday. First at home, and then on the computer at work (which TRAMPs back to my journal file back at home). 

Here's a look at my capture template:

 `(setq org-capture-templates`

 `'((""j"" ""Journal Entry"" entry (file+olp+datetree ""~/Documents/Journal/journal.org"")`

`""* %T %a\n%?"" :tree-type week)))`

Here's how it looks like in my agenda, which I use a lot: 

[journal is my org file, where at once time I tried \\""journaling\\"" category.](https://i.redd.it/dcegxxpdci911.png)

I like this idea. It changes how I think about how I journal now. Instead of having more of a daily ""diary"" where I write everything down, I now try to write in shorter bursts, usually two paragraphs at a time, that has to do with an event happening. No event = no journal entry (even though I could do one, you can see from the first).

I've used emacs for various coding tasks the last couple of days and I've gotten quite comfortable editing code in emacs, although the lack of modality requires quite a different mindset when coding. I have a couple of questions regarding plugin/package development for emacs and the capabilities for drawing stuff in the editor window (I want EM/Powerline to be primarily for the GUI version):

1. Is it possible to draw arbitrary graphics like lines/boxes in any buffer? For EasyMotion the jump labels should ideally be on a separate layer and/or in another font instead of replacing text in the window like with the current vim version. I've not been able to find any decent documentation on the subject, so it would be nice if anyone could point me in the right direction.
2. I understand that it's possible to draw graphics in the modeline. I can't find any docs on this either, so any help here would be great.
3. I'm completely new to elisp and lisp in general, but I'd love to learn it (it's also kinda required if I'm going to write plugins for emacs). Are there any tutorials specifically dealing with plugin development for recent versions of emacs?
4. It would be great if anyone interested would join me in developing Powerline and EasyMotion for emacs. Working on these plugins alone has been quite a challenge, and thankfully I've gotten a lot of help on the Python version of Powerline. The emacs plugins would need to be written completely from scratch in elisp (ideally), so any help would be awesome.
5. Lastly, I'd like suggestions on what to name these plugins. They'll need some new names to distinguish them from their vim counterparts, so let me know if you have any cool naming suggestions!

"Another week, another trick. This week, I will present you my way to handle my spelling  mistakes with GNU Emacs, which may be the nightmare for some. Of course, I'll talk about `abbrev-mode` and `flyspell`. For those who don't know these modes yet, `abbrev-mode` allows you to correct your words on the fly according to a list of misspelled words and `flyspell` enables spell checking on-the-fly in GNU Emacs. Basically this is what it looks like:

[Overview of flyspell](https://i.redd.it/9dsog6r9es411.png)

Roughly, `abbrev-mode` can be configured as below. This code will allow you to globally activate `abbrev-mode` and load your abbreviations file silently:

    (use-package abbrev
      :defer 1
      :ensure nil
      :custom
      (abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "".abbrev_defs"" user-emacs-directory))
      (abbrev-mode 1)
      :config
      (if (file-exists-p abbrev-file-name)
          (quietly-read-abbrev-file)))

**NOTE:** you can already find a well filled `.abbrev_defs` file [here](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/2941a8021928689a5c47d1c2ff8c5d721491b517/.abbrev_defs).

Thus, if you have this line in your abbreviations file:

    (""owrk"" ""work"" nil 0)

When you will write owrk, this word will automatically be replaced by *work*.  Great, isn't it?

Likewise, it is possible to add and edit your abbreviations as you wish. Despite this, it is difficult to correct your mistakes based only on `abbrev-mode`, which is why `flyspell` comes into play.

Similarly, `flyspell` configuration is simple:

    (use-package flyspell
      :defer 1
      :custom
      (flyspell-abbrev-p t)
      (flyspell-issue-message-flag nil)
      (flyspell-issue-welcome-flag nil)
      (flyspell-mode 1))
    
    (use-package flyspell-correct-ivy
      :after flyspell
      :bind (:map flyspell-mode-map
            (""C-;"" . flyspell-correct-word-generic))
      :custom (flyspell-correct-interface 'flyspell-correct-ivy))

**UPDATE:** I updated the code and the image above with the useful `flyspell-abbrev-p` variable, which allows to automatically save changes made by `flyspell` in your `abbrev_defs` file.

The above code allows you to globally activate `flyspell` so that it pushes you to highlight misspelled words and easily correct them with the `C-;` keyboard shortcut.

Be careful that I use `ivy` to use the correction interface, but you can also use `helm` with `flyspell-correct-helm`, or use a popup window with `flyspell-correction-popup`. However, the configuration remains the same.

For `hydra` fans here is the menu I use:

    (defhydra hydra-spelling (:color blue)
      ""
      ^
      ^Spelling^          ^Errors^            ^Checker^
      ^────────^──────────^──────^────────────^───────^───────
      _q_ quit            _<_ previous        _c_ correction
      ^^                  _>_ next            _d_ dictionary
      ^^                  _f_ check           _m_ mode
      ^^                  ^^                  ^^
      ""
      (""q"" nil)
      (""<"" flyspell-correct-previous :color pink)
      ("">"" flyspell-correct-next :color pink)
      (""c"" ispell)
      (""d"" ispell-change-dictionary)
      (""f"" flyspell-buffer)
      (""m"" flyspell-mode))

Here's what you'll get:

[Overview of hydra](https://i.redd.it/bxzw4pjfnp411.png)

This makes it easy to change dictionaries, correct mistakes and so on.

I'm not going too deep into this post, because you can do a lot of things with them. Besides, I'm curious to know your tricks in the comments for these modes. Also, one solution that would interest me with `abbrev-mode` is to be able to use other abbreviation files depending on the language. For instance, I sometimes have to write documents in French and I couldn't find a global abbreviations file on the web, like I did with English. Moreover, with the machine learning, I think we could create something more useful where these abbreviation files could create itself from our errors.

For the curious, you can find my config on [GitHub](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d).

"I've got this idea for an Emacs minor mode that brings elements of RPGs into every day Emacs use. This is a rough idea, and I don't have the skill or time to try to write this myself, so I thought I'd throw it out here to see what you all think.

With this mode, you would have a point score and a persistent RPG style level. As you use Emacs for normal things, your key strokes will slowly increase your point score, and you'll level-up when your score passes certain thresholds. So far this is a bit boring, but consider the following additions

* Bonus points for using a command for the first time, with bigger bonuses for using more obscure commands

* Bonus points for using a keybinding instead of execute-extended-command, maybe with bigger bonuses for longer and/or more obscure keybindings

* Bonus points for doing things the ""right"" way. We won't all agree on exactly what that is, but for example you might get bonus points for using isearch to move somewhere in the visible part of the buffer, or using C-n, C-p etc instead of arrow keys

* You might have a health meter and receive damage for doing things the ""wrong"" way, like using the mouse for anything that can be done with the keyboard, moving a long distance using just forward-char, backward-char etc. Maybe you lose a level if your health gets too low? Or maybe if you die, your .emacs.d is deleted!

* Bonus points for the length of time or number of keystrokes without leaving Emacs (i.e. changing focus to another app)

* Bonus points for using a major or minor mode for the first time

* Bonus points for doing more than text editing in Emacs (email, RSS, eww, pdf-tools etc)

* Bonus points for installing packages, and maybe for more advanced configuration of your init file (use-package, custom code&#x2026;)

* A badge in the mode line showing your level, points, health etc

* An ascii-art avatar with character customisation and loot, with extra customisations getting unlocked at higher levels. This should be presented on a nice screen that we can share to brag about our Emacs prowess

* Loot drops randomly coming from running commands, with a higher probability and rarer loot associated with more obscure/advanced commands

* Boss battles could be vimgolf style challenges that have to be completed in a minimum number of keystrokes. A new one could be unlocked with each new level and give a unique item of loot when defeated.

"I've been using Emacs for about two years and decided to try Spacemacs. I've heard good things and loaded it up once or twice before but never really played around with it. I fully committed for two weeks. Here's a list of things I really liked, things I wasn't a fan of, a short reasoning for why I decided to stay with my own config, and some hopes I have:

Great things: 

* The ability to roll back package updates easily 

* Pre-configured layers that can auto-install if you open a ruby (or whatever) file 

* Really good defaults (whoever came up with Emacs' default scrolling needs a stern talking to in my book)

* I really like the *idea* of the mnemonic keybindings. I ended up disliking how Spacemacs does it, more below

Not so great: 

* Even though I used Emacs style keybindings, evil mode was still loaded and occasionally I was left in ""normal mode"" after executing a command 

* The quality of layers varies *dramatically*. Some were awesome, others barely worked. I never got org-projectile to work at all from the org layer

* Since it's originally based on Evil/Vim, all the keybindings felt one step too far. For example, everything to do with buffer manipulation is under SPC b in evil mode. But if you use Emacs bindings, SPC becomes M-m, so it's M-m b. But if you're rebinding everything anyway, why not eliminate the M-m part and just make it M-b? 

* Inconsistency of bindings: When invoking org-capture, you can refile with C-c C-w (as in Emacs default). But that does NOT work in a normal org file (it brings up some eyebrowse functions instead). Instead, you must use M-m a o R for ""leader key"" ""applications"" ""org"" ""refile"". While that's easy to remember, the fact that it's different in while org-capturing vs org-moding normally is obnoxious. This kind of thing happens fairly frequently. 

Sticking with my own config: 

I decided to stay with my own config for a few reasons, much of which boils down to the fact 

A) I don't get dumped into evil mode nonsense randomly 

B) I have more control & it's easier to figure out what's going wrong (with Spacemacs I couldn't figure out if it was my problem, Spacemac's problem, or the package's problem).  

C) Can define my own keybindings easily (in Spacemacs it's sometimes hard to understand when you need global-set-key vs emacs-state or whatever). 

Hopes I have from Spacemacs for the Emacs community: 

* I don't pay attention to the Emacs mailing list, so I have no idea if this is happening, but I really hope that Spacemacs is submitting stuff upstream. The ability to roll back package updates is tremendously helpful when a package breaks *right* when you need it

* Similarly, I wish that Spacemacs was a bit more modular. It would be nice, for example, to be able to load Spacemacs's scrolling settings (or parens settings or maybe even whole layers) without needing to install the whole beast. I'm not sure if packages via MELPA are the best route here; maybe Spacemacs could be broken into smaller chunks and hosted separately? 

Anyway, those are some of my shorter impressions. Hopefully you find it interesting/useful. And I'm happy to answer questions.

"I made this [pull request](https://github.com/tumashu/org-webpage/pull/8) into org-webpage, it will be accepted soon if everything is in order, God willing :).

This basically makes org-webpage use [`rclone`](http://rclone.org/) to upload the generated content. Which means you can upload your blog or website to Google Drive, Amazon S3, Openstack Swift, Rackspace cloud files, Memset Memstore, Dropbox, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon Drive, Hubic, Backblaze B2, Yandex Disk and even sync different directories in your local storage.

I also took some care improving the UX of this package, because sometimes you may screw the `:remote` option, now org-webpage checks if the `car` of `:remote` is a valid symbol, either `'git` or `'rclone` and will issue a helpful message to the user if he is adding other than those two symbols.

"Yesterday Microsoft released the Anniversary Update for Windows 10, which includes the possibility to use Ubuntu Bash natively. The first thing I tried was installing emacs and I noticed it installs version 24.3.1. I'm not sure if I'm in the right subreddit for this, but it might be a good start.

Is there any way to install the latest version or even the 25rc1 through this?

"So I've been trying to figure out the best way to go about autocompletion in emacs. I switched from vim 6 months ago, and I've been loving emacs ever since. However the one thing I've been missing in emacs that I loved in my vim setup is the autocompletion. IMO YouCompleteMe is one of the best autocompletion experiences there is, and I've been struggling to set up something comparable in emacs. (I should note that I'm primarily concerned with Python and C/C++.) I've tried quite a few things, and what I've learned is that it seems like company mode is the way to go as opposed to autocomplete for a completion framework due to company mode's modularity, but when trying to figure out the best backends to use I've been coming up short. For the C-family languages, I've found the default clang backend to be quite slow, and the semantic completer is a bit better but still doesn't feel as responsive as the experience I had in vim with YCM. It seems like this may just be a fundamental limitation with any backend implemented in elisp. I've been looking into irony mode, and it seems promising due to using an external damon process implemented in C++, but at this point it seems like I should just go through the involved processing of setting up emacs-ycmd to regain all the YCM awesomeness. Along this journey for better autocompletion, I realized that the two reasons why none of the autocompletion solutions I've found for emacs can compare to YCM are 1) the fuzzy matching algorithm and 2) the intelligent ranking algorithm. It seems these two features are what worked together to make YCM feel like it was reading my mind whenever it offered completion candidates. From this I realized that no matter how good a backend you had for company, it really would be limited by the frontend candidate transformation function as otherwise the ranking of candidates given by company will often put the desired completion far away, making the completions less useful. So even though emacs-ycmd will give me the fuzzy match candidates, it doesn't seem like it can give me the intelligent sorting.

Give all this, I was wondering what solutions people have found in their own setups for autocompletion? Perhaps there is some package I've overlooked which offers completion as good as YCM? Or maybe I'm just mistaken about something I've said here?

TL;DR Emacs is great, except for autocompletion where I which there was something as good as the YouCompleteMe vim package. Tell me your thoughts on this.",45,49,Autocompletion in Emacs: what to do?,emacs

"What I learned:

If a web page contains navigation 'link' elements with 'rel' attributes for ""next"", ""prev"", ""up"", or ""start"" (plus a few supported synonyms), then you can navigate in `eww` by typing `n`ext, `p`revious, `u`p, `t`op; just like you do in the `info` reader.  So far, so nice.

The eye-opener was when I used isearch in a page, ran out of matches in the buffer, typed `C-s` again to wrap around, and unexpectedly found myself looking at *the next page containing a match, in that sequence of web pages*.

i.e. This is like isearch in `info` -- but working on web pages.  eww keeps following those ""next"" links until it finds another page with a match for the search term.  (Internally this is using misearch.el, so the amount of code needed in eww turns out to be absolutely minimal. Very cool.)

For locally-hosted HTML documentation in particular (which eww is perfect for, and for which this behaviour will be fast), this feature is absolutely superb.

If you're using eww for documentation, and the HTML doesn't contain navigation 'link' elements, this is reason enough to ask the maintainers to add them.  (And if you're *not* using eww for this, it's probably reason enough to start.)",13,46,eww's awesome isearch support just blew my mind,emacs

"Fountain Mode is a major mode for screenwriting in Fountain markup: https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode

I’m planning to tag release 2.4.0 soon, which is a large release with over 260 commits. I’d like to put it out to the community for testing before calling it “stable” so the release notes below represent the master branch, available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/fountain-mode).

Feel free to report issues either here or on GitHub. Obviously if things are broken, but I’m also interested in if things are just confusing...

## New Features

- The biggest user-facing change is probably the addition of `fountain-dwim` on `TAB`:
  - If point is at a scene heading or section heading, or if prefixed with ARG (`C-u TAB`) call `fountain-outline-cycle`.
  - If point is at an directive to an included file, call `fountain-include-find-file`.
  - Otherwise, upcase the current line and active auto-upcasing. This highlights the current line with face `fountain-auto-upcase-highlight` and will continue to upcase inserted characters until the command is called again (TAB) or point moves to a different line (either by inserting a new line or point motion). This allows a flexible style of entering character names. You may press TAB before, during or after typing the name to get the same result.
- Another big feature is that Fountain Mode can now give an approximate page count:
  - `fountain-count-pages` on `C-c C-x p` will print the current page of total pages in the echo area, e.g. “Page 16 of 78”
  - Option `fountain-pages-show-in-mode-line` (nil by default) can be set to show the current page of total (e.g. “[16/78]”) either with automatic or manual update. Automatic update uses an idle timer that can be set with `fountain-pages-count-delay`.
- Export to plain text, creating an output like that of scripts on www.imsdb.com
- Added [Mountain](https://github.com/mjrusso/mountain)-style include workflow: files can be included with `{{ include: FILENAME.fountain }}` where FILENAME is relative to the current file
- Display scene numbers in the right margin. (Requires a margin width greater than 0, e.g. with [Olivetti](https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti).)
- Added teleplay format with its own aligning and exporting settings.
- A customisable title template for each export format.
- Command `fountain-insert-page-break` (`C-c C-x RET`) will calculate appropriate position before point to break page (e.g. never separating character names from dialogue, or breaking sentences).
- Section and scene headings in HTML output are now anchored and hyperlinked allowing easy bookmarking.
- New faces inherited from more appropriate Font Lock faces.

## Improvements

- Menu organisation has been greatly improved.
- When `fountain-auto-upcase-scene-headings` is non-nil, editing a scene heading will overlay the line with a highlight.
- Custom options that change buffer display somehow (e.g. alter Font Lock keywords) now have set functions to automatically apply their updates, without having to call `fountain-mode` again.
- `fountain-goto-scene` and `fountain-goto-page` now call `push-mark` before relocating point, so that `pop-mark` will return you to where you were.
- Toggling including a title page works for all export formats.
- `fountain-continued-dialog-refresh` is now fast enough to work on the whole buffer, and if you’ve changed `fountain-continued-dialog-string` it will attempt to remove previous string first.
- Exporting to Final Draft will now recognise when an element starts a new page (i.e. page breaks).
- Emphasis delimiters are not fontified on minimum decoration level.
- Keymap now remaps existing bindings to analogous functions (e.g. `forward-list` to `fountain-forward-scene`) to suit users who have already have their own bindings for these.
- Incredible parsing speed improvements by using `comment-use-syntax`.
- A rewritten parsing and export model.
- Appropriately naming private variables (e.g. `fountain--outline-cycle`).

## Bug Fixes

- Removed some Font Lock multiline calculations that may have slowed things down.
- Fixed some scene heading font issues.
- Always check for CR as well as LF.
- “Go to” is two words.
- Many other small fixes.

And finally, I’ve added my Bitcoin Cash address to the README for anyone who wants to leave a tip 😎

"So I've been reading lamentations along the lines of ""how come all the really great configurations like Spacemacs are for vimmers?""

https://github.com/bodil/ohai-emacs

It has a very nice structure and includes heaps of things I've been meaning to try out for a while. I should confess I've been using emacs now for over 30 years (Gosling, Micro, X and then GNU emacs) and in all that time never really used much more than a simple .emacs with some nice keybindings. It has been a constant friend and wonderful tool.

But since reading /r/emacs, I've been wanting to try out some of the uber cool stuff out there - ohai-emacs has loads of good stuff and is practically ready to run - just drop it into a replacement .emacs.d and you're away!

3. My main working org-mode agenda view

I'd also want a consistent arrangement, e.g. 1 & 2 stacked on the left, 3 on the right. Because these aren't all existing files but buffers that need to be generated/updated as necessary, I can't work out a consistent way of setting them up and and arranging them in a consistent manner - `window-configuration-to-register` doesn't really do what I'm after.

- Then, I created 2nd workspace with initial buffer is Spacemacs home buffer; you will also see `[2]` highlighted in the minibuffer to indicate you are in 2nd workspace. After that, I opened the `~/emacs.d` directory in Dired.

- Then, I created 3rd workspace and similarly you see Spacemacs home buffer and `[3]` highlighted in the minibuffer. After that, I opened `~/nand2tetris/projects/` directory.

- I switched back and forth between workspaces for you to see the window layout of each workspace. Finally I close all but first workspace and ended up in `.spacemacs` file again.

The nice thing with `eyebrowse` is that it remembers the last window layout I was using in a workspace, so I never have to worry about saving and restoring window configuration explicitly once a workspace is created. The difference between `eyebrowse` and `perspective` is that `eyebrowse` doesn't try to isolate buffers into different groups like `perspective`.

"* [Composable](https://github.com/paldepind/composable.el)

I have always been a fan of the *idea* of how highly composable commands and objects are in Vim, but I've also been using Emacs since 1993 so I'm not changing editors now, heh.  But Composable provides a similar concept to Emacs.  For example, with it you can `C-w C-w` just like Vim's `dd`.  Or `M-w 3 f` to copy the next three words.  Or `C-SPC s` to mark an s-expression.  Et cetera.  You can easily create composable versions of commands that operate on regions, e.g.

    (composable-def '(avy-move-region))

* [Selected](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el)

Selected is a minor mode which lets you easily define commands to perform on a selected region.  For example:

    (use-package selected
      :diminish selected-minor-mode
      :config
      (selected-global-mode t)
      :bind (:map selected-keymap
                  (""q"" . selected-off)
                  (""u"" . upcase-region)
                  (""d"" . downcase-region)
                  (""c"" . count-words-region)
        	      (""i"" . indent-region)
        	      (""w"" . copy-region-as-kill)
                  (""m"" . apply-macro-to-region-lines)))

Given this setup, if I mark a region and press `i` then it will indent the entire thing.  Pressing `m` will run the most recent macro on each line.  And so on.

* [Webpaste](https://github.com/etu/webpaste.el)

Pretty simple: it lets you quickly publish a region or entire buffer to one of many different pastebin-ish services---five of them, at this time of writing.  I've found it to be useful for sharing code with my peers.

"Being a vim + sublime user in academics (I do some CS/statistics work, some development, a lot of latexing), I have always craved for something better. Vim offers fast editing of remote files, enabling a lot of system admin work. But recently I get into web programming and Python for data processing. Inevitably I feel the pain of using vim as a semi-IDE for fast work. Sublime has been serving me well, it's fast, intuitive, has great support for latex via the latextools plugin and have some IDE features for html/css/js/python (one can work in sublime with great productivity same day of installation), plus it's written in Python! Configuration is super easy with the JSON file.

However, I have craved for something better, that combines the clear advantage of vim and other more modern programming editors like sublime.

So I tried emacs, three times. First time I just used the stock version of gnu emacs came with my system. Too much to learn, quit in 2 days. I have to say, the kbds are not intuitive, at all!

Second time, I came across a starter kit for social sciences, it was frustrating since some packages just couldn't get straightened out. It was improving my experience though. I used it for a week and went back to vim + sublime.

This time, I was recommended spacemacs by a colleague. With some doubts, I asked around. Most people were like, nah, go with the pure emacs, don't do starter kits. Some encouraged me to try it out since it was working out well for them (some are 20 year old programmers so there is some credibility).

I tried out the standard version of spacemacs config. Boom! Everything is plug and go, perfect. However, I did want something simpler, so i switched to spacemacs base version.

After a few days of exploration, encouraged and informed by the spacemacs documentation, design and community, I have more than 500 lines of codes in my dotspacemacs file that I actually understand.

These three days have been amazingly enlightening to me: an ex-vim/sublime user. I have already configured an emacs development environment far better than my vim or sublime environment. And I am exploring more, hoping to contribute back to the emacs community some day.",42,43,My experience of using spacemacs for just under a week,emacs
"For information on what GNU Hyperbole is, screenshots, download and
installation instructions, see the GNU Hyperbole home page:

   https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole

The Hyperbole wiki page:

   https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole

explains the many ways it differs from and is complementary to Org mode.

Hyperbole includes an interactive demo to introduce you to its features and a
detailed reference manual.

===========================================================================
*                 What's New in GNU Hyperbole V6.0.2
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - pathname Implicit Button Type: generalized to handle hash-style links to
      HTML files, to Github Markdown # sections and to Emacs outline *
      sections.  So an Action Key press on any of the following links displays
      the link referent:
            ""man/hyperbole.html#Questions-and-Answers""
            ""README.md#why-was-hyperbole-developed""
            ""DEMO#HTML Markdown and Emacs Outline Hash Links""
      Even links split across 2 lines like this now work: ""DEMO#Social Media
      Hashtags and Usernames"", as long as point is on the first line.

      Within HTML and Markdown files, in-file hash links without any file name
      prefix work as well.

      HTML hash-links are case-sensitive; other hash-links are not.  Hash links
      typically use dashes in place of the spaces that referents may contain,
      but if the link is enclosed in quotes, Hyperbole allows spaces to be used
      as well.  In fact, it is best practice to always enclose hash-style links
      in quotes so Hyperbole can distinguish them from other similar looking
      constructs, such as social media hashtags (see ""(hyperbole)Social Media"").

      Pathnames surrounded by literal non-ASCII quote marks now work as well.
      For example, ‘http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/’.

    - New Implicit Button Type, markdown-internal-link, displays any in-file
      Markdown link referent, aside from pathnames and urls.  Together with
      other types, all Markdown links can now be followed by the Action Key.

    - social-reference Implicit Button Type: Disabled this type within quoted
      strings (all modes) and within parentheses (markdown-mode), so in-file
      hash link references are not matched as social hash tags.  Made the list
      of modes a variable, hibtypes-social-inhibit-modes.

    - New link-to-web-search Action Type: Allows global and explicit buttons
      to link to specific web term searches from `hyperbole-web-search-alist'.

    - org-mode Implicit Button Type: Improved to invoke org-meta-return when
      not on an Org link or outline heading.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added pointer to HyControl video and {C-c \} binding which invokes
      HyControl window control.

    - README File: New Org-mode user testimonial.

    - DEMO File: Added description and exercise using the new Find/Web menu.

    - Added README.md.html introduction with images combining README, INSTALL
      and HY-ABOUT information.

    - Full set of hand-written changes are now in the file ""Changes"".  The
      former name, ChangeLog, is now auto-generated from the version controlled
      'git log' but not as complete.

  KEYS

    - New variables, action-key-eol-function and assist-key-eol-function, used
      to control what the Action and Assist Keys do at the end of a line.
      Default behaviors remain as before but now one can set these to do
      something other than scrolling, if desired.  See ""(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Smart Scrolling"".

    - When in HyControl, pressing {ESC} now quits in addition to {q}.

  MENUS

    - New submenu, Find/Web, for quick access to major web search engines.
      The Find/Web menu looks like this:
        Web> Amazon Bing Dictionary Elisp Facebook Google Hub(git) Images Maps RFCs StackOverflow Twitter Wikipedia Youtube

      Hyperbole binds the key {C-c /} for quick access to this menu, if it is
      not already bound prior to Hyperbole's initialization. The
      Cust/Web-Search menu, {C-h h c w}, sets the option,
      hyperbole-web-search-browser-function, which determines whether web
      search results are displayed within Emacs or with an external web
      browser.  A short video introduction to the Find/Web menu is available;
      see https://youtu.be/8lMlJed0-OM.

      Advanced users can change the search engines listed in the Find/Web menu
      with M-x customize-variable RET hyperbole-web-search-alist RET.  Changes
      are automatically reflected in the Hyperbole menus once applied.
      Remember each search engine name must begin with a unique letter and each
      URL must have a %s format field indicating where to place the web search
      term when a search is performed.  See ""(hyperbole)Web Search Engines"".

"Hey All,

I am at a point where I have been thinking about writing my own custom functions to make emacs do more for me. One of my set backs is learning elisp. I have also become very interested in functional programming in general so I have thought of learning things like Scheme, Haskell, or Scala.

I came across this: [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhyDoesElispSuck#toc20](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WhyDoesElispSuck#toc20) and thought a bit about it. But, really emacs lisp is just for emacs so it seems to work well for that purpose.

So, here are my questions.

Is emacs lisp worth learning to extend the emacs editor or should I just stick with being able to tweak things to my liking?

Would my time better be spent learning Scheme, Haskell, or Scala and would that possibly make picking up emacs lisp much easier?

Has anyone taken the time to really master emacs lisp and saw a great improvement in their workflow?

"I love org mode. Use it daily, my org-directory contains almos 190k lines - agendas, lists, wikis. 

It. Is. Amazing.

But...

I feel also very passionate about knowledge management - storing and linking concepts, links, text.

 Org-mode does a great job on some of the points, but there are also a few very critical restrictions the main two for me are:

1. org-files are linear/tree structured - concepts however form a network.

2. links are only one-way (no automatic backlinking, transclusion).

i.e. ""animals"" link to ""dog"" ""mouse"", ""mouse"" links back to ""animal"" but also to the ""computer"" entry, at the moment you linked ""mouse"" to ""computer"" the link from ""computer"" to ""mouse"" got created too.

While I understand this is a matter of personal choice, there are only two systems that I know about that do get many things ""right"":

[The Brain](http://www.thebrain.com/)


[Freex-mode](https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex)

Brain is unfortunately not open source and has virtually no linux support. The closedness is particularly worrisome if you pour in literaly 100s of hours building up your database.

Freex seems great, open, within emacs. Unfortunately is not supported, I didn't get it to run on any of my machines and org-mode wasn't really supported.

The recent [org-wiki](https://github.com/caiorss/org-wiki) has some nice features (easy linking/node creation, attachments), but the most critical parts are not in the scope of the project (understandably, this is not a complaint).

I hadn't experienced any such problems myself, but for sure Spaceline did much more at runtime than it strictly speaking needs to.

The new version attempts to fix this by turning Spaceline into something like a modeline compiler. Most decisions that *can* be made statically *are*, and this has had some great effects on performance, at least according to my profiling (see [comment](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/4552#issuecomment-217741584)). About 5-6 times faster and less than half as much allocation as the old version.

Most users *shouldn't* experience any changes. Many of the lightweight configuration options will now no longer take any effect until you call `(spaceline-compile)` to recompile all modelines. Examples include changing separator styles or directions or redefining the segments. If you've been manipulating the modeline spec in `spaceline-left` and `spaceline-right`, those variables are now gone and you should have a look at `spaceline--mode-lines` instead. Any changes to these require recompilation also.

I've gone through the documentation to make sure it's up to date, so if you are experiencing problems have a read, or ask here.

Part of the reason is that I'm too disorganized and undisciplined; my notes and reminders consist of a mixture of computer files, emails, calendar entries, and bits of scribbled paper which get left lying about the house.  And of course sometimes I'm at a computer with emacs; other times I'm not: I might be at a Windows computer at work, or on my (Android) phone or tablet.

"I've run into a couple of general techniques to speed up startup of emacs.  Here's a summary of what I've found to work well.

* Use emacsclient.  The most obvious thing to do is to use emacsclient instead of emacs; if you do that, a pre-existing emacs ""server"" instance will be used, if available.  That way, there *is* no emacs startup.  If you want a new graphical window each time, `emacsclient -a """" -c` is probably what you want; the `-a """"` will cause a new emacs instance to be started if one isn't already running, and `-c` will cause a new frame to be opened.

    I like running emacs in a terminal only, with a new xterm popping up containing an emacsclient instance if emacs is launched from, say, Firefox.  If you think you'd like the same behavior, I've just [posted a script](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1auowq/script_for_using_terminalbased_emacs_as_editor_on/).
    
* Many packages require loading for use to be made of them.  Since this often requires modifying one's ~/.emacs.d/init.el file to contain a `(requires 'foo)` snippit, it adds to the difficulty of using emacs for new users.  Many Linux distros simply have emacs packages that must be loaded drop off a file in `/etc/emacs/site-start.d`.  Every time emacs is started, it executes every file in here, and loads every package installed on the system.  This makes things simpler for a user — he doesn't have to see any elisp.  However, it also means that every emacs instance startup runs slower as more packages are installed on the system.

    If you're comfortable with loading up what you want and don't like the startup overhead, you can run `emacs --no-site-file`.
    
* Where possible, use `autoload` instead of `require`.

    It's possible to tell emacs in your ~/.emacs.d/init.el, ""if anyone tries to run function `foo` and it hasn't been loaded yet, load `bar.el`, and then try again to execute `foo`"".  This is done via a statement like the following:

        (autoload 'ibuffer ""ibuffer"" ""List buffers."" t)
        (global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer)

    The `global-set-key` function will tell emacs to run the fancy colorized, grouping `ibuffer` package instead of the simpler `list-buffers` when a user his `C-x C-b`.  The `autoload` function says ""if the user tries running function 'ibuffer, and that function hasn't yet been loaded, try loading a file called ""ibuffer.el"" or ""ibuffer.elc"" and then repeat the attempt.
    
    This way, if you don't actually use ibuffer in a particular emacs run, ibuffer is never loaded up.
    
    I use autoloading heavily in my init.el:
    
        (autoload 'gid ""idutils"" nil t)
        (autoload 'gnuplot-make-buffer ""gnuplot"" ""open a buffer in gnuplot mode"" t)
        (autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on ""ansi-color"" nil t)

    So on most emacs sessions, these packages never need to load.

    Another really common time I need to autoload something is if I install a package to handle a particular filetype.  Then, whenever I open that filetype, I want emacs to load up the package with the mode required to edit that filetype, and switch to the mode...but I don't want emacs to read through code to handle a bazillion different filetypes unless it really needs to do so.  Sometimes, I have multiple possible modes to edit a filetype, and some systems have one mode and others another...I'd like to load up only the mode that is actually installed on the system and that I most like.  Heres' the function I use, and some examples:
    
        (defun find-in-list (f list)
          ""Find an element for which f returns true in list and return that element""
          (let ((templist list))             
            (while (and templist (not (funcall f (car templist))))
              (setq templist (cdr templist)))
            (if (null templist)
                nil         
              (car templist))))

        ;; Given a list of ((filetype-regex, (""libname"", ""Description"",
        ;; 'function-symbol)...)...), for a given filetype, finds the first
        ;; libname that is present, and sets filetype-regex to autoload the
        ;; specified function-symbol in libname for that filetype-regex.
        (defun autoload-filetype-with-preference (regex description list)
          ""Autoloads for given regex a preferential list of libs/function pairs""
          (let ((mode-pair (find-in-list (lambda (x) (locate-library (car x))) list)))
            (if mode-pair
                (let ((mode-name (cdr mode-pair))
                      (mode-file (car mode-pair)))
                  (autoload mode-name mode-file description)

    In the above example, I'm loading up tuareg-mode for Ocaml files if it's available on a system.  If not, I fall back to sml-mode.  If that's not available, I just use whatever emacs defaults to.
    
    All code released to the public domain.

* Use locate-library to only use a particular feature if a system has it installed.
    
    I often work with older systems; some don't have, say, ibuffer installed.  I'd hate to have to maintain a different init.el for those systems.  What I do is make the load conditional on the library being present, so that my init file won't fail while trying to autoload a package that isn't present:
    
        ;;; ibuffer
        (if (locate-library ""ibuffer"")
            (progn
              (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
                    (quote ((""default""
                             (""shell"" (mode . shell-mode))
                             (""dired"" (mode . dired-mode))))))

              (add-hook 'ibuffer-mode-hook 
                        (lambda ()
                          (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups ""default"")))

              (setq ibuffer-show-empty-filter-groups nil)

              (autoload 'ibuffer ""ibuffer"" ""List buffers."" t)
              (global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer)))

* Timestamp your load messages to profile loading time

    This one doesn't actually speed up loading, but it does help you see what is hogging your startup time.  Normally, packages print messages in your \*Messages\* buffer as emacs loads up; you can ask emacs to timestamp these so that you can see what it is that's causing the slow startup.
    
    Thanks to [other /r/emacs users](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16tzu9/anyone_know_of_a_reasonable_way_to_timestamp/) for helping me put this one together:
    
        ;;; timestamps in *Messages*
        (defun current-time-microseconds ()
          (let* ((nowtime (current-time))
                 (now-ms (nth 2 nowtime)))
            (concat (format-time-string ""[%Y-%m-%dT%T"" nowtime) (format "".%d] "" now-ms))))

        (defadvice message (before test-symbol activate)
          (if (not (string-equal (ad-get-arg 0) ""%s%s""))
              (let ((deactivate-mark nil))
                (save-excursion
                  (set-buffer ""*Messages*"")
                  (goto-char (point-max))
                  (if (not (bolp))
                      (newline))
                  (insert (current-time-microseconds))))))

EDIT: modified `find-in-list` to not eat stack space linear in the size of the list, as per nitroll's comment below.  Elisp doesn't do tail-call optimization!  Unlikely to break in the usage here here (since the list is unlikely to be long), but bad for a general-purpose list-processing function.

&#x200B;

A while ago I announced [Peach-Melpa.org](https://Peach-Melpa.org) and I've intermittently been doing work and trying to observe some of the feedback I got back from you (and thanks by the way, it was quite positive overall). The quick changelog:

* HTTPS, yay! With Certbot, was a lot easier than I thought;
* More themes available: I was assuming ""single"" type for themes packages, but there are also ""tar"" , so now both are correctly retrieved and parsed;
* A proper test suite to stop developing in the dark;
* Some CSS fixes, even though someone in another thread described it as quite ugly :'(
* **Multi languages!** Lisp is the default displayed in the listing page, but if you enter a page theme you will see there is now Javascript, C, Ruby and Org-Mode alongside. It's been quite hard to find samples that reflected nice code and practices and even though it's entirely subjective, I'm happy with them at the moment.

It's not very much but the goal is to display all MELPA themes properly and that means the next big piece is handling all themes that have light/dark variants before I can start adding features like brightness/darkness (already have some code for it), other fonts, which modes are implemented (org, magit, ediff etc), custom input and what you have.

"[The first of two major PRs](https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine/pull/17) is about to be merged on the [Outshine](https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine/) package.  For historical reasons, Outshine used to (re)define a lot of functions and variables in the `outline-` pseudo namespace, conflicting with the built-in Outline it extends, and reintroducing long-fixed bugs in the process (because some of the `outline-*` functions it defined were actually provided by Outline, but Outshine redefined them using older definitions!).  This PR removes most of these definitions, and renames those that no other package provides.  This is the first step in making Outshine a polite citizen of modern Emacs world.

We (/u/github-alphapapa and myself) believe the changes should have absolutely no effect beyond fixing some bugs and quirks in Outshine but... it's a big refactoring, so you never know.  We thus kindly ask Outshine users to give [thblt's `leave-outline-alone` branch](https://github.com/thblt/outshine/tree/leave-outline-alone) a try before it gets merged, and [report](https://github.com/alphapapa/outshine/issues) any issue you encounter --- try to make it reproducible if you can, but report anyway!

Merge will happen on October 20th, 2018, around 12:00 UTC, should be picked up by Melpa the usual way, and will be tagged so that Melpa Stable picks it up as well.

Thanks!

"I've spend the day berserk-coding on a bunch of features I had in mind for a while for the upcoming release of
[Emms](https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/) 5.0.

It should hit MELPA any minute.

In short:

- The [mpv](https://github.com/dochang/emms-player-mpv) backend has been merged.
- Opus tags can be read properly if `opusinfo` is installed.
- Info/Tag queries are an order of magnitude faster (customizable).
- Org-style TAB / SPC bindings: they cycle through the different levels of expansions.
- `emms-browser-move-up-level` is now interactive and bound to `^`.
- `emms-add-tracks` (bound to `<return>`) has been extended to add all tracks
  in the region.  It's also possible to use a numeric prefix argument to add
  that many tracks.  The point now moves forward so that you can keep pressing
  `<return>` to add a series of tracks.
- Use the new `emms-browser-remove-tracks` function to clean-up Emms browser
  manually.  (Call with a prefix argument to delete the associated files.)
- Or use the more radical `emms-cache-reset`.  (This won't delete any file.)
- The Emms browser tree now also uses `albumartist` instead of only `artist`.
- I've fixed an issue with cover thumbnails not always showing.
- I've fixed `emms-smart-browse` so that it does not cascade endlessly when a browser search is on.

For the newcomers, here is my setup (roughly):

	(require 'emms)

	(emms-all)
	(emms-history-load)

"I have a very specific question: what can emacs do that vim cannot?

I am destined to make emacs my new OS to improve productivity. I have been using vim for about 15 years now. I have seen all corners or vimscript and my vim config reads like prose. But then I hit the point where the plugins do 80% of what I want and the rest of the 20% requires me to patch upstream plugin code. No thanks.

I already made the switch to emacs, with evil-mode and my familiar vim mappings. And I have discovered that emacs provides fine tuning for about everything. I have severe ""editor OCD"" so if it doesn't work just right, I will end up tweaking for hours on end. For example, in org mode you can just set a var org-cycle-separator-lines that allows you to specify the amount of newlines between closed/opened folds/headings. Now that is the fine tuning I want.

But overall... what can emacs do that vim can't? Is it the fact that emacs really can be your OS, with org-mode, calendar, gmail, etc. right from within emacs?",114,41,"What emacs has to offer over over vim, besides evil and elisp",emacs

2) quick auto-completion
3) git-integration
4) integrated debugger

"Having used Emacs for the past 6 months, the only part of my work that i haven't replaced was shell. I still use iTerm2.
My issues with shell-mode, multi-term, eshell .. etc are:
1) Clunky colors and weird cursor behavior when i use zsh and oh-my-zsh in my ~/.zshrc (agnoster theme).
2) Alot of shortcuts that i use such as Ctrl-R were available in some (but the mode wasn't convenient) or it wasn't and the mode was ok.
3) Lack of documentation and discussions according to my search about configuring shell to the level where it's usable.

Have you had similar experiences? do you use emacs whatever-shell-mode, or are you sticking to iTerm2 like me? Did someone write a better ""sensible-defaults"" for shell that work close to what iTerm2 can offer?",24,43,Emacs shell configuration for 2016?,emacs
"It is for NeoVim, but apparently like in case of Eclim it has a client and server part and an emacs client can also connect to the server. AFAIK IntelliJ is snappier than Eclipse, so it can be an alternative of Eclim, using IntelliJ as an excellent completion backend. If you know Elisp and think it can be useful then you may want to hook it up to company or some other completion backend and post your experiences.

"Once upon a time, @mathpunk [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mathpunk/status/694405249042219008):

> The period key on my keyboard has come off This is a problem It means that when I talk online it sounds like I talk face to face I'm sorry

I [replied](https://twitter.com/howardabrams/status/694418313024176128) with a joke:

> Sorry… Have a few from my keyboard ………………………..

And [then another](https://twitter.com/howardabrams/status/694418074481496064):

> Quick, advise the new-line function to insert a period… #emacs ftw!

Since I know that @mathpunk uses Emacs, he asked for details. While I wasn't sure I wanted to attempt late-night Lisp Incantations on an iPhone, I came up with this code:

    (advice-add 'newline
                :before
                (lambda (&optional arg int)
                  (when (> (current-column) 0) (insert "".""))))

I mention this story as it explains some strange and odd approaches to both solving problems, but in innovative ways.  Now, I'm looking for similar goofy, but technical wizardry that would be at the fringes of typical Emacs usage.

"So, Helm is too heavy weight because it uses the header line and a source header line that can cost you 2 to 3 lines of screen estate in total. You want something that look like [this screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/51729e91b2aa7378bc54b7a8ce8ec597584a6ae1/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6e3345776556332e706e67) of [grizzl](https://github.com/grizzl/grizzl)? Now you have it. With the current latest Helm, you can disable the header line in a Helm window with:
    
    (setq helm-display-header-line nil) ;; t by default

Then, you can turn off the source header line with:
    
    (set-face-attribute 'helm-source-header nil :height 0.1)

Helm window is too big? That's why you have `helm-autoresize-mode`: 
    
    (helm-autoresize-mode 1)

The resizing is too annoying and you only want the window to be less varied or even at a different fixed size rather than the default size? It can be done with:
    
    (setq helm-autoresize-max-height 30)
    (setq helm-autoresize-min-height 30)

Now, you have a Helm window that always takes 30% of your frame height.

One of the thing that annoyed me with Ido is that it is always at the bottom in the minibuffer and raise the mode line. If you are like me, you may want to open Helm window in the current window where point is in, so you don't have to move eyes far away from the upper-half of the window to the minibuffer. This is problematic if you have large monitor (i.e. 24 inches or above).

By setting this:

    (setq helm-split-window-in-side-p t)

Now, Helm always opens a small window right inside and at the lower half of current window. No more random Helm window!

This is [the end result](http://i.imgur.com/SeRjOiH.gifv).

**Update**: You may want to remove the header line for Helm command with only one source. For Helm command with multiple sources, the header line appears as a very thin line. This is fine, but if you want Helm to be a bit smart, that is, keep the full source header line when multiple sources and hidden when there's a single source, you can add the following function to `helm-before-initialize-hook`:

    (defvar helm-source-header-default-background (face-attribute 'helm-source-header :background))
    (defvar helm-source-header-default-foreground (face-attribute 'helm-source-header :foreground))
    (defvar helm-source-header-default-box (face-attribute 'helm-source-header :box))
    
    (defun helm-toggle-header-line ()
      (if (> (length helm-sources) 1)
          (set-face-attribute 'helm-source-header
                              nil
                              :foreground helm-source-header-default-foreground
                              :background helm-source-header-default-background
                              :box helm-source-header-default-box
                              :height 1.0)
        (set-face-attribute 'helm-source-header
                            nil
                            :foreground (face-attribute 'helm-selection :background)
                            :background (face-attribute 'helm-selection :background)
                            :box nil
                            :height 0.1)))
