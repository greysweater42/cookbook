# 1. What is javascript and why would you use it?

* javascript is a relatively simple language (at it's basic level it's pretty similar to java and C++), which makes your dashboards enev more interactive and user-friendly. This is obviously data scientist's point of view.

* works smoothly with flask, but also with shiny (with shiny it's slightly less straight-forward, as in flask you create your webpage's layout in html, while in shiny - in R).

# 2. Simple examples to start with



# 3. Tips and tricks

* you can execute your javascript interactively in console with `node`
