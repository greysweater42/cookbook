# cookbook

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/tomis9/cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomis9/cookbook)

*programming tutorials and snippets prepared by tomis9* available at [tomis9.github.io].


This repo contains all the posts written in markdown and Rmarkdown, that are published on my blogsite. Before being published, they are compiled using (Hugo)[https://gohugo.io/] on (travis)[https://travis-ci.org/].


If you think about writing your own blog, I highly recommend this workflow, as it is:

* simple - in order to publish a new post or make a change to an existing one, all you have to do is 'git push' to the github repository;

* it is 100% free of charge;

* you can learn it quickly with help of many tutorials available on youtube;

* there are lots of nice and free themes, ready to use on your website, so you don't have to struggle with css and html. Unless you're a frontend developer or you just enjoy it.
