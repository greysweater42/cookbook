rstanarm (TODO)
</center>

## 1. What is rstanarm and why would you use it?

* it's an R interface to [stan](https://mc-stan.org/)

* it's better than rstan, because (according to [rstanarm webpage](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstanarm))

    * models are specified with formula syntax,

    * data is provided as a data frame, and

    * additional arguments are available to specify priors.

* in other words, rstanarm let's you estimate and examine various bayesian models in R as well as display their results using [shinystan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan).
