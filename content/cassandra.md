cassandra (TODO)
</center>

Installation is described on the [cassandra webpage](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html), but it didn't work for me, so I've decided to use cassandra's docker image.

This is a very nice tutorial of setting up a 3-node cluster of cassandra od docker, creating a simple table, populating it with data and retrieving results.

Looks like a decent example of using cassandra on (docker with python)[https://mannekentech.com/2017/01/02/playing-with-a-cassandra-cluster-via-docker/].
