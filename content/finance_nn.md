## 1. Intro

### 1. Why I'm making this project

There are two main reasons for this project:

- I've recently deep dived into pytorch and I want to test in on a real task. I've been using pytorch extensively at work, but I usually didn't have enough time to study its quirks as thouroughly as I wanted.

- As I was studying Quantitative Methods in Economy, my all-time dream was to predict fluctuations on the stock market, i.e. come up with a legal money factory. During the studies I realized that this isn't possible, but I still want to give it a try ;)

### 2. What I expect to gain

- a good understanding of LSTM nets

- proficiency in pytorch

- an end-to-end project in pytorch for future reference

- *any* money ;)

### 3. First thoughts

- I need to collect the data. The best source for me will be Warsaw Stock Exchange, as I am Polish, so I hopefully I'll have some intuition about the stock I buy/sell.

- First I will concentrate on regular stock market, later on maybe I'll delve into some more exotic instruments, like derivatives.

- What if there are many irrational players on the market, so my algorithm could outsmart them?
