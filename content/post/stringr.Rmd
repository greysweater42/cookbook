## 1. Why would you use stringr?

Actually, you wouldn't, because stringr has been completely replaced by stringi.

## 2. A "Hello World" example

```{r}
library(stringr)

str_c("a", "b", "c")

str_length("abcdefg")

str_sub("tomek", 2, 4)

str_trim("   abc  ")

str_replace("blanana", "na", "HEJ")
```
