## 1. What are R packages and why woul you use them?

* R packaging is a convenient way to store and share your R code. 

* It lets you incorporate testing with [testthat](https://tomis9.github.io/testthat).

* It lets you easily list dependencies with [packrat](https://tomis9.github.io/packrat).

* You can easily version your code.

You may say: well, I can benefit from all of these advantages by simply keeping my code in a git repo and you know what? You would be right. Maybe except the dependencies, however you could take care of them providing a file similar to python's requirements.

In general, I don't recommend encapsulating your code into a package, unless you want to publish it on cran. Your workflow will require one more step whenever you change your code, i.e. reinstalling the package.

## 2. A "Hello World" example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
library(roxygen2)

setwd('~/.R/my_libs')
create('hello_world_package')
setwd('./hello_world_package')

document()  # creates manual/documentation

setwd('..')
install('hello_world_package')  # install package
```
