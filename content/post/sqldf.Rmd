## 1. What is sqldf and why would you use it?

`sqldf` package lets you treat any data.frame object as an sql table. You can write queries just as if you were using a database. Pretty useless, comparing to, say, data.table, dplyr or tidyverse.

But someone created it and let's appreciate this beautiful piece of useless work.


## 2. A "Hello World" example

```{r}
library(sqldf)

sqldf('select * from mtcars where mpg > 21')

sqldf('select mpg, cyl, disp from mtcars where cyl = 6')
```
