## 1. Intro

### 1. Why I'm making this project

There are two main reasons for this project:

- I've recently deep dived into pytorch and I want to test in on a real task. I've been using pytorch extensively at work, but I usually didn't have enough time to study its quirks as thouroughly as I wanted.

- As I was studying Quantitative Methods in Economy, my all-time dream was to predict fluctuations on the stock market, i.e. come up with a legal money factory. During the studies I realized that this isn't possible, but I still want to give it a try ;)

### 2. What I expect to gain

- a good understanding of LSTM nets

- proficiency in pytorch

- an end-to-end project in pytorch for future reference

- *any* money ;)

### 3. First thoughts

- I need to collect the data. The best source for me will be Warsaw Stock Exchange, as I am Polish, so hopefully I'll have some intuition about the stock I buy/sell.

- First I will concentrate on regular stock market, later on maybe I'll delve into some more exotic instruments, like derivatives.

- What if there are many irrational players on the market, so my algorithm could outsmart them?

## 2. Data

I've been searching for APIs to Warsaw Stock Exchange for a while, and I convinced myself that maybe I should try something more user-friendly for a start. I found [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/best-5-free-stock-market-apis-in-2019-ad91dddec984) article which propeses *yfinance* by Yahoo. Let's give it a try.
(but [IEX](https://addisonlynch.github.io/iexfinance/stable/) looks interesting as well)

Aw, that is a great opportunity to remember how [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/line-charts/) works.

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/bin/python3'}
import yfinance as yf
import plotly.express as px
import plotly
import json

msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

ms = msft.history(period="max")
ms.reset_index(inplace=True)

fig = px.line(ms, x="Date", y="Close", title='Microsoft stock prices')
```
```{python, eval=FALSE}
fig.show()
```
```{python, echo=FALSE}
fig = json.dumps(fig, cls=plotly.utils.PlotlyJSONEncoder)
```

```{r display_plotly_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(jsonlite)
plotly::as_widget(
  jsonlite::fromJSON(
    reticulate::py$fig, simplifyVector=FALSE))
```
*btw., displaying plotly in Rmarkdown file is ridiculously complicated*

OK, it looks like I got some data.

*To be continued...*
