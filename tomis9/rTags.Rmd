and, obviously, [Nvim-R plugin](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) documentation (RBuildTags).

You don't necessarily have to read these articles (unless you want to understand what you are doing). All you have to do is to run `:RBuildTags`, Nvim-R will create a tags file in your current directory and vim will automatically read this file each time you open any .R file in this directory. As simple as that.

To move into a function's location, type <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>]</kbd>, just like in vim's help files.

Remember to re-run `:RBuildTags` each time you add a new function to your project in order to update the list of tags. If you have a feeling that you will reload it quite often, think about a special mapping to add to your .vimrc, e.g.

```{vimscript}
autocmd FileType r nmap <buffer> <F6> :RBuildTags<CR>
```
